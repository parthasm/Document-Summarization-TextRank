Abstract

A complete review of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
elements and of the experimental methods for their determination is presented.
A critical analysis of the relevant experimental results, and in particular of the
most recent ones, allows to improve the accuracies of all the matrix elements.
A 2 minimization with the three-family unitarity constraint on the CKM
matrix is performed to test the current interpretation of the CP violating
phenomena inside the Standard Model. A complete and unambiguous solution
satisfying all the imposed constraints is found. As a by-product of the fit, the
precision on the values of the matrix elements is further increased and it is
possible to obtain estimates for the important CP violation observables sin2,
sin2 and . Finally, an independent estimation of the CKM elements based
on a Bayesian approach is performed. This complementary method constitutes
a check of the results obtained, providing also the probability functions of the
CKM elements and of the related quantities.

1 Introduction

One of the most interesting and mysterious aspects of nature is its behaviour under
Charge-Parity (CP) transformation. For more than 35 years after the discovery of CP
violation in the neutral kaon sector, no conclusive evidence of violation of this symmetry
has been found in other phenomena, but a huge experimental effort is being made in this
direction. The main reason for the interest in this field is related to the question whether
the Standard Model is able to account for the observed magnitude of these phenomena.
CP violation is introduced, in a general way, into the charged-current weak interactions
between quarks existing in at least three different families. In the Standard Model, it
originates from an unremovable complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa1,2
(CKM) matrix, which describes the flavour mixing between the quark states. With this
formulation, it is possible to foresee many different CP violating phenomena, which will
be a matter of study in the current (as well as in the next) generation of B factories. In
order to have reliable estimations for these phenomena, as well as to test this sector of
the Standard Model, a precise knowledge of all the matrix elements is necessary.
The values of the CKM matrix elements are not fixed by theory and must be evaluated
on the basis of the available experimental information. This can be performed by
studying specific classes of processes, such as, for example, the semileptonic decays of
mesons or baryons, and by exploiting the relations between the experimental
determinations of decay rates or branching ratios and the relevant matrix elements. The
theoretical uncertainties in the hadronic system description usually limit the final
precision obtained in the determination of the CKM matrix. Notwithstanding this
difficulty, which in some cases makes the related experimental information even
unserviceable, all the CKM matrix elements of the first two rows can be safely
determined.
The requirement that the CKM matrix be a unitary matrix imposes strong constraints
between its elements. This characteristic allows one to test the goodness of the values
found and of the assumptions made in the Standard Model in order to account for the
observed CP violation.

The main purposes of this work are a survey of the CKM matrix elements as
determined one by one from the experimental data and the refinement of their values by
means of a unitarity-constrained minimum-2 fit. The main results of this study already
appeared in Refs. 3 and 4. The impact of new measurements foreseen in the next years
is also emphasized.

In the following paragraphs, a short introduction to the CKM matrix and the
unitarity triangle is presented. In Section 2, the direct measurements of the CKM matrix
elements and other experimental constraints are discussed taking into account the most
recent experimental, theoretical and phenomenological achievements. In Section 3, we
present the methodology used to obtain the maximum precision for the CKM parameters
from the results presented in Section 2, through the requirement that the CKM matrix be
a 3×3 unitary matrix. Finally, the determination of the imaginary part of the matrix and
the best estimation of the CP violating observables are presented.

1.1 The CKM matrix


In the Standard Model, the quark mass eigenstates (physical states) do not take part
as pure states in weak interactions. The unitary transformation connecting the two bases
of mass and weak eigenstates is represented by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
matrix. By convention, the charge +2/3 quarks (u, c and t) are chosen to be pure states,
and flavour mixing is described in terms of a 3×3 matrix operating on the d, s and b
quark states:

d
d V V V
ud us ub d
s = V (1. 1-1)
CKM s = V V V
cd cs cb s


b b V V V
td ts tb b
Thus d', s' and b', instead of d, s and b, are partners of u, c and t respectively within
the weak isospin doublets.
All the properties of weak quark interaction are codified inside the CKM matrix, which
makes it possible to extend the Cabibbo1 model, preserving the weak coupling
universality while explaining the existing priority scale among the transitions occurring
inside one quark family and those connecting two neighbouring families, or the first with
the third one. Its structure incorporates the GIM5 mechanism, which suppresses the
flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) processes. Finally, the imaginary part of the
CKM matrix is the source of all the CP-violating phenomena which the Standard Model
is able to account for.
CP symmetry, which is equivalent, according to the CPT theorem, to time reversal
invariance T, would be conserved if the matrix were real. On the other hand, to account
for CP violation V must be complex independently of the phase convention of the
CKM

fermionic fields, which it acts on. The Lagrangian density term which represents the
( ±
W -mediated) charge current processes involving quarks depends on V according to

Let us consider initially the most general case. As an N×N unitary matrix, V depends
CKM
2
on N real parameters, 2N - 1 of which can be reabsorbed by the quark fields which
multiply the right and left sides of the matrix, by means of a global redefinition of the
arbitrary phases. Of the remaining (N - 1)2 free parameters, N (N - 1)/ 2 are the Euler
angles, common to the real (orthogonal) matrix and to the complex (unitary) one, the
others are unremovable complex phases; they are therefore physically meaningful and
can be measured as signals of CP violation. The N = 2 matrix, which contains only one
parameter (the Cabibbo angle), is real; consequently, it cannot give rise to CP violation.
This is precisely the reason why Kobayashi and Maskawa3 conjectured the existence of
three quark doublets in 1973. The authors presented the hypothesis as one of several
possible explanations, which were able to account for CP non-conservation with a
minimal extension of the two-generation model. But the idea began to be held in high
consideration when Perl and collab. 6 discovered the third lepton () in 1975, following




4


up the original intuition and preceding experience of Zichichi and collab.7, and after the
discovery of the fifth quark (b) at Fermilab8 in 1977.
The CKM matrix (N = 3) can be parametrized in terms of three Euler angles and one
phase; the latter is entirely responsible for the CP violation in the Standard Model.
Several possible parametrizations differ both in the choice of the Euler angles and in the
positioning of the phases; the one proposed by Chau and Keung9 combining notations
already used by Maiani10 and Wolfenstein11 is adopted by the PDG12 as the `canonical'
parametrization:

where

Given the experimentally observed hierarchy among couplings

is obtained. This parametrization, formulated by Wolfenstein11, has the advantage of
making the characters which differentiate the CKM matrix from a common unitary
matrix particularly evident: it is almost diagonal (the diagonal elements are close to
unity) and its elements decrease in magnitude with increasing distance from the

diagonal, according to a nearly symmetrical pattern ( V V at the first non-zero

parametrization.

(the first provides a way of testing the unitarity condition, with reference to direct
measurements of the elements of the same row), Eq. (1. 2-3) is of particular interest, as
it defines on the complex plane a triangle whose sides have dimensions of the same
order in ( ( 3

one of the sides can be normalised to the real value 1: dividing Eq. (1. 2-3) by

A very preliminary measurement of this asymmetry has been performed recently by
CDF13, but given the lack of precision it cannot be interpreted as a definitive proof of
CP violation in the b quark sector. New, precise measurements of this quantity are
expected in the forthcoming years from dedicated experiments like BaBar, Belle and
HERA-B, which should start their physics data taking since the beginning of the year
2000. Moreover, the upgraded version of the CDF detector should provide new results
from the beginning of 2001. Finally, the LHCb experiment should be operative from
year 2006. These experiments will be active at different machines ( + -
e e colliders, pN
fixed target, p
p and pp colliders) and with different experimental techniques. This will

lead to independent determinations of the angles of the unitarity triangle. The attainable
precision will also depend on the technique used and on the actual value of these
quantities.

2 Experimental determination of the CKM matrix
elements

As it will become explicit in the following Subsections, the possibility of carrying
out independent measurements of the CKM matrix elements and other observables
connected with weak decay amplitudes is due to the great precision with which the
Fermi constant G was measured.
F

The measurement of the muon lifetime, by which G is determined, has been the
F

subject of nearly half a century of experimental inquiries14, which began in the early
Forties. The first accurate measurement was carried out at CERN15 in 1962 and, for the
first time, an inconsistency with the coupling constant of the nuclear transition
14 O14N + +
e + clearly emerged. One year later this evidence led Cabibbo1 to a new
e

formulation of the weak-coupling universality principle. The present level of precision
was achieved in 1984 by the Saclay-CERN-Bologna16 and TRIUMPH17 groups. The SCB
group also provided one of the most meaningful tests of CPT invariance through a
determination of the ratio
+ - . From the world average of these measurements, the

following value of G is obtained12 taking into account the radiative corrections:

Sections 2. 1 to 2. 6 describe the direct measurements of the CKM matrix elements of
the first two rows. In most cases, the main source of uncertainty in the values obtained
is the theoretical interpretation of the experimental results. In fact, detailed calculations
of hadronic terms are generally needed to relate the measured quantities to the CKM
elements. Moreover, different theoretical approaches do not always give univocal
predictions. For example, in the recent investigations of rare B decays the data analysis
is strongly dependent on the model used. The problems of theoretical interpretation are
not restricted to the latest results: the extraction of V from the hyperon decay
us

measurements, for example, still cannot rely on a solid agreement between independent
theoretical calculations. As a further example, the lack of consistency between the very
precise V value obtained from the analysis of nuclear decays and the unitarity of the
ud

CKM matrix has led to the formulation of a number of (not yet fully established)
hypotheses which can explain the discrepancy with the expected value by predicting
additional nuclear structure effects. The discussion of these aspects is essential in
obtaining reliable estimations of the CKM matrix elements.
From a different point of view, the main interest in the measurement of the
observables which are related to the elements of the third row (B meson mixing, CP
violation parameters) is the chance of revealing the existence of new physics, since the
hypotheses involved are subject to a wide range of possible modifications in the
extensions of the Standard Model. The information available on the elements of the third
row will be collectively discussed in section 2. 7, since all the measurements give
combinations rather than single CKM elements.

2.1 |Vud|

Super-allowed nuclear transitions, neutron decay and pion decay are the
experimental sources which provide basic information for the determination of V .
ud

Several difficulties are encountered in the theoretical description of these processes when
tracing back from the hadron to the quark level (u d) transition. The result obtained
from the study of nuclear decays is sufficient to make V the CKM matrix element
ud

known with the greatest precision; nevertheless, additional nuclear corrections, which
have been proposed in order to account for a 2 incompatibility with the value expected
assuming unitarity, may still have to be applied. The deduction of V from neutron
ud

decay has to deal with the historical inconsistency between the independent
measurements of the axial coupling constant as well as of the neutron mean-life. Pion
decay provides the cleanest way of extracting V , but a suitable level of precision has
ud

still to be attained through a refined measurement of the decay rate.


2.1.1 Super-allowed nuclear decays

The most precise and the largest amount of experimental information on V comes
ud
from the analysis of super-allowed nuclear decays, in which the spin-parity P +
J = 0
and isospin of the nuclei are preserved. Due to the energies released in these processes,
the so-called allowed approximation assumes that the emitted leptons have zero relative
angular momentum. Under this hypothesis, the + +
0 0 nuclear decays can be simply
described considering only the vector part of the weak interaction (Fermi transitions).
Moreover, the nucleus involved in a transition occurring within an isospin multiplet is
labelled with the same quantum numbers in the final state as in the initial one; then,
assuming an exact isospin symmetry and that the other nucleons behave as spectators,
the initial and final nuclear states are completely superimposed, so that the nuclear
matrix element can be assumed independent of any detail of the nuclear structure and is
given by a simple isospin coefficient. In this way the experimental values of ft ­ the
product of the phase space factor f, depending on the atomic number and the end-point
energy, and the half life t of the specific process ­ are expected to be nearly the same in
all the super-allowed transitions.
For the super-allowed transitions occurring within isospin T= 1 multiplets, ft is defined
by

A more accurate description of these processes, which includes the small (of the
order of 1%) and calculable contribution of electromagnetic effects and radiative
corrections, leads to the following expression:

symmetry breaking.
The nucleus independence of the t value and its direct correspondence to the V
ud

matrix element are two important theoretical aspects which make the study of super-
allowed nuclear transitions particularly useful for the determination of V . From an
ud

experimental point of view, the study of these reactions is simpler than that of neutron or
pion decays and more precise measurements can be obtained. The ft value of a super-
allowed transition A A
X + Y + + e
+ is determined by measuring the total half-life,
e
0 0

the branching fraction (R) and the end-point energy of the specific process, which can be
clearly identified by measuring the relative yield and the energy of the monochromatic

rays emitted in the Y nuclear de-excitations.
The averaged experimental results of nine super-allowed decays, including the
recent data for 10 C (particularly relevant as it is close to the Z= 0 limit where the effects
of the nuclear structure vanish) have been collected and updated by Towner and Hardy18
(see Table I). The radiative and nuclear structure corrections have been evaluated taking
into account the results of several independent calculations19. As expected, the corrected
ft-values are in fact mutually compatible. Their weighted average
t = 3072.3 ± 0.9 ± 1.1 = 3072.3 ± 2.0 s (2. 1-4)
(where the second error is due to the systematic difference between two independent
computations of and has been added linearly to the statistical error) leads, with
C
= (2.40 ± 0.08) 10-2,
(2. 1-5)
R

to the following measurement of V :
ud

V = 0.9740 ± 0.00014
ud exp ± 0.00048 th = 0.9740 ± 0.0005 (2.1-6)
(the second error represents the uncertainty on the radiative corrections).

In spite of its precision, the value of V obtained from nuclear decays has been
ud

often criticized due to the inconsistency it presents with the unitarity of the 3×3 CKM
matrix. Combining the result 2. 1-6 with the best values of V (2.2-16) and V (2. 4-
us ub

4), in fact, a deviation of 1. 9 from unity is found:
2 2 2
V V V . (2. 1-7)
ud + us + ub = .
0 9971± 0015
.
0

This result may indicate that the value 2. 1-6 is underestimated. Various attempts have
been made to explain this inconsistency by including additional corrective factors.
On pure phenomenological grounds, Wilkinson20 admitted a residual dependence of t
on Z and tried to extract it from the experimental data. After extrapolating t to Z = 0
the value V = 0.9746 ± 0.0006 was obtained.
ud





10


Saito and Thomas21 proposed a physical model of the infinite nuclear matter, in which
the influence of nuclear binding, mediated by meson exchange, is studied in terms of the
quark degrees of freedom. A non-negligible charge-symmetry violating effect was found
to involve the quarks inside bound nucleons, resulting in an additional correction to the
ft value, which should raise V by 0. 06 to 0. 08%,
ud

V = 0.9747 ± 0.0006, (2. 1-8)
ud
lowering the discrepancy with the unitarity condition to 1 .
Since none of the model proposed have been clearly established yet, they are not applied
directly neither in Ref. 18 nor by the PDG12. However, we follow the PDG in enlarging
the uncertainty in the determination of V :

constants of axial and vector currents (both take part in the decay of neutrons) are in this
case the experimental parameters required for the determination of V 18:

experimental data concerning neutron decay are shown in Table II.

The results of several measurements, based on two different experimental
techniques, are used for the determination of the neutron mean life.
i. The method used in the first experiments consists in counting the decays which
occur in a definite portion of a continuous or pulsed neutron beam. The precision of
the result depends mainly on the accuracy with which it is possible to determine the
spatial dimensions of the observed part of the beam and its density of neutrons.
From these quantities the initial population, N 0 , can be computed; the mean life is

derived from the relation ( -
N - N N = e
0 , where N is the number of the
t ) t
0 t

neutrons which have decayed in the transit time t.
ii. The recent development of techniques for the production and the accumulation of
ultra-cold neutrons (having kinetic energy lower than -7
310 eV ) has considerably
reduced the sources of systematic errors in the measurement of the mean life. Very
slow neutrons can be confined within material walls or magnetic traps. By counting
the number of neutrons inside the cell as a function of time, can be determined
n

as the only parameter of the exponential decay law. The efficiency of the detector
(which does not affect the measured ratio between the populations at different
times), the volume of the cell and the initial density do not need to be known and it
is not necessary to detect the decay products.

The ratio g g between the axial and vector coupling constants can be determined
A V

by measuring the parameters describing the correlations between neutron spin and lepton
momenta. The decay probability per unit time has the following expression:
p p p p p ×p
e e ( e )

where E , p and
e
E , e
p are the energies and the momenta of the electron and the

antineutrino, the neutron spin).
i. The axial part of weak interaction is responsible for an anisotropic production of the
electrons. The number of electrons emitted in the same direction as the nuclear spin
(
N ) is smaller than the number of electrons going in the opposite direction (
N ).
Consequently, when the neutrons are polarized the term which correlates neutron
spin and electron momentum is non-zero and its coefficient

of the electron-neutrino angular correlation is measured, since it is the only term of
the decay probability which does not depend on neutron spin and therefore does not

It should however be noticed that single measurements of g g would lead to different

determinations of V which in some cases are incompatible with each other, with the

nuclear result and with unitarity. For example, when the measurement by Abele at al. 38
is used alone (not averaged), it leads to the value V = 0.9712 ± 0.0020, which is even

The experimental uncertainty should be reduced by a factor of 10 before it becomes
comparable to the theoretical error. A new, more precise measurement of the decay rate,
therefore, would be essential. It would make it possible to get around the controversial
aspects of the theoretical description of nuclear decays, and provide an unambiguous
determination of V without requiring the knowledge of additional experimental

parameters such as the axial coupling constant in the case of neutron decay.

2.2.2 Hyperon semileptonic decays

The deduction of V from hyperon semileptonic decay rates requires a more
us

complex theoretical analysis. While the kaon decays are described by the vector
interaction alone and thus the SU(3) symmetry-breaking occurs at the second order only
(Ademollo-Gatto's theorem), an accurate study of hyperon decays requires the additional
computation of the more substantial (first-order) correction for the axial form factor.
Donoghue, Holstein and Klimt48 (DHK) computed SU(3)-breaking corrections up to the
second order for the vector part and to the first order for the axial one, and applied them
to the WA2 data (SPS) combined with the previous world averages (ten distinct hyperon
decay channels in all)49. Finally, they quoted the result

V = 0.220 ± 0.001
us exp ± 0.003th, (2. 2-13)

where the error is evidently dominated by the theoretical uncertainty. The PDG12 do not
use the hyperon decay result to determine the best value of V . Flores-Mendieta et
us

al. 50 tested the reliability of four distinct theoretical models which provide second order
SU(3)-breaking corrections for hyperon semileptonic transitions and pointed out a strong
model-dependence of the results. In particular, using the DHK model they found a value
of V noticeably higher than the one originally determined by the authors themselves
us

(2.2-13), and much less consistent with the kaon decay data. This disagreement may be
explained as the result of a different treatment of the experimental data. For example, in
Ref. 50 only the three most precisely measured decay channels instead of the original ten
were taken into account. This reduction in the experimental basis increases considerably
the relative statistical weight of the -
e

- data, which is the one showing by far

the worst agreement with the DHK model, as already found by the authors themselves.

analysis50 quote the value obtained using the chiral perturbation model of Ref. 52 as the
best determination of V from hyperon decays:
us

V = 0.2176 ± 0.0026. (2.2-15)
us

However, they also show that values ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 25 can be obtained by
applying different models.

Since apparently unresolved theoretical uncertainties still affect the description of
hyperon decays, we prefer not to use these results. Therefore, we assume the
determination obtained from kaon decays
V = 0.2200 ± 0.0025 (2.2-16)
us

as the best value, noting however that it is in good agreement with the results of two
different analyses of hyperon semileptonic decays.

2.3 |Vcd| and |Vcs|

A measurement of the matrix elements V and V can be obtained from the
cd cs

study of the deep inelastic scattering of neutrinos on nucleons. For the determination of

V the experimental data concerning the D K e
+
semileptonic transitions and the
cs e
recent measurements of the ±
W hadronic decays are also used.


2.3.1 |Vcd|

V and V can be extracted by comparing the cross sections of the charm

production induced by neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering on nucleons.

The dimuon production from neutrino-nucleon scattering can be described as a two-
stage process (see Figure 3). The charge-current interaction of the neutrino with a d or s
quark yields the first muon and changes the quark flavour into charm. The second muon,
having the opposite charge, is the result of the semileptonic decay of the c quark:

* The following method is used to take the asymmetric errors into account. Each error is treated
as a function of the parameters, which is constant and equal to the positive or negative error
when the current value of the unknown term of the constraint falls outside the positive or the
negative margin; in the intermediate region, the function is matched continuously by a straight
line.

2.4 |Vub|

CP violation can be included in the framework of the Standard Model only if all
elements of the CKM quark-mixing matrix have non-zero values. This fact justified the
strong experimental and theoretical effort devoted to the determination of V , which is
ub

expected, on the basis of the unitarity condition, to be very small.
The observation of an excess of events in the lepton end-point spectra, interpreted as the
result of charmless semileptonic decays of B mesons, was made by CLEO68 at CESR
and ARGUS69 at DESY in 1990 and gave the first experimental evidence70 of a non-zero
V . The subsequent experiments were faced with the hard task of a precise
ub

determination of its value. The main difficulty in measuring signals from b
-
u
processes arises from the large background induced by the stronger b
-
c
transitions. The contribution of the charmed B decays can be suppressed by looking for
exclusive decays were charmless final states can be directly observed by means of
invariant-mass peaks. Such measurements, though easier from an experimental point of
view, involve the transition between the heavy B meson and a light daughter hadron,
which is extremely challenging to describe precisely, and lead to model-dependent
results. This approach, successfully exploited by the CLEO collaboration in the
measurement of the 0 0 - +
B -

+ B
and branching ratios, led to the

following average determination of V (see Table IV):
ub

V = ( 0
+ 21
3 25
. ± 0.14 . ± 0.55 10
-0 , (2. 4-1)
.29 ) 3-
ub CLEO exclusive

where the errors are respectively statistical, systematic and theoretical.

Exclusive measurements, feasible with the B production at the (4#), are not
effective at LEP, where the lepton momenta in the b-hadron rest frame cannot be
reconstructed with sufficient accuracy, the efficiency of the B decay vertex
reconstruction depends on the charge multiplicities of the final state and the
fragmentation of the b quarks produces different particles which dilute the signal. These
disadvantages are compensated for by the back-to-back topology of the b quark
production from Z decays, which avoids the mixing of the B decay products. This
characteristic is fully exploited by a novel technique based on the study of the shape of
the invariant mass of the hadronic system recoiling against the lepton in b
-
u
transitions. The analyses, up to now performed by the ALEPH and L3 collaborations,
have allowed the determination of the b X inclusive branching ratios quoted in
u

Table IV. The basic remark is that a smaller model-dependence is expected in predicting
the shape of this invariant-mass distribution, while the recent progress in the theoretical
calculations has succeeded in containing the uncertainties at the level of few percent71.

2.5 |Vcb|

The charmed semileptonic decays of B mesons constitute the experimental basis for
the direct determination of the matrix element V . In this Section, two different
cb

methods, which make use of exclusive and inclusive measurements, are described.


2.5.1 Exclusive decays

A number of research groups have carried out measurements of V studying the
cb


B D B
D
and exclusive decays in the kinematic configuration in which the
D meson is produced at rest (zero recoil) and the energy of the lepton-neutrino system is
at its maximum.
In the context of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET)77, which approximates
the masses of the heavy quarks involved in the process (b and c in this case) as infinite,
the hadronic form factors appearing in the expressions of the differential semileptonic
decay rates can be defined using one universal function ( )
w (Isgur-Wise function),

which is independent of the initial and final heavy mesons. This form factor describes
the superposition of the light quark wave functions. The maximum overlap is reached in




26


the limit of zero recoil, for which the normalization (w = )
1 = ( 2 2
q = q ) =1 is
max
adopted; here 2 2 2
w = 2
v v = m + m - q m
2 m , and q = (p p
B - D )2
B D ( B D ) ( B D) is the square
momentum transferred to the leptonic system, with 2
q m m . However, the
max = ( B - D )2

analytic form of the function cannot be predicted within HQET. Therefore, to extract the
value of V the differential decay rate
cb

2
d G 2
F 2

w m ,m ) ( )
w V (2. 5-1)
3 B D
dw 48 cb

(f is a known function measuring the density of states) is measured in the limit of zero
recoil, where the matrix element is the only unknown factor. Due to the reduced
observable statistics at the point of zero recoil (w= 1), the data are collected in the range
w> 1; the value of 1
( ) V is then obtained by extrapolating to the limit w 1+. For
cb

this purpose the function ( )
w , a priori unknown, is parametrized as a Taylor

expansion around the point w = 1:
2
( )
w = 2
( )[
1 1- ^ (w - )
1 + ^c(w - )
1 + ]
(2. 5-2)
(the first derivative must be negative, since the condition w = 1 corresponds to the
maximum superposition of the wave functions and thus to the maximum of (w)). The
value of the intercept ( )
1 V is then extracted from a fit to the differential decay
cb

data. Although not all the experiments are sensitive to the quadratic term ( ( )
w is often

assumed to depend linearly on w), basic QCD considerations favour a positive value of
the curvature c^ , having a definite correlation with the slope 2
^
( ^c .
0 66 ^ 2
- .
0 11 )78.

The form factor ( )
1 , which equals 1 at the leading order in the HQ expansion, is then
determined by calculating perturbatively the effect of the finiteness of the heavy quark
masses. While the second order 1 m ( m or m ) power corrections have been
Q = m
Q b c
computed in the case of
B D
decays, for which the (1 m term is absent79, at
Q )

present the B
D decays can be described with less theoretical accuracy, since only
the first order of the expansion is known. Moreover, both the overall branching ratio
and the rate near the point of zero-recoil are smaller for the B
D mode, thus
limiting the precision of the measurements.
From the experimental analysis of the
B D exclusive decays, CLEO and the
LEP experiments obtained accurate determinations of the parameter ( )
1 V . The data
cb

are displayed in Table V. OPAL and DELPHI derived their results using a quadratic
parametrization of the Isgur-Wise function, while a linear dependence was assumed by
CLEO and ALEPH. We do not report the results of other measurements carried out by
ARGUS80 (
B D B
D
), ALEPH84 and CLEO81 ( ), which provide less precise
(though consistent) information.
Since the LEP measurements, though presumably highly correlated, are scarcely
consistent even within their total errors, we compute their weighted average separately
(in this way we avoid diluting the reduced 2 with the contribution of the independent
measurement by CLEO) and rescale the error by the factor 2

The measurements of the inclusive branching ratio of B semileptonic decays to

observed phase-space, which requires an extrapolation to the low momentum region in
order to recover the full decay rate, leading to a model-dependent measurement. This
technique led CLEO, ARGUS, and CLEO II to the direct measurement of the ratio

XE
9 FE
9 (Table VI). Recently, the DELPHI collaboration, by means of a technique based
on the study of the shape of the invariant-mass distribution of the hadronic system
recoiling against the lepton, has produced a new measurement of the XE
9 FE
9 ratio,
which takes into account the whole lepton spectrum (Table VI).
We get a further estimation of the XE
9 FE
9 ratio using our reference values for XE
9
and E
9 derived in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 (Eqs. 2.4-4 and 2.5-10):

XE
9 = 0.091 ± 0.013.
E
9 (2.6-1)
By taking the weighted average of this value with the DELPHI determination we obtain
the following evaluation of the XE
9 E
9 ratio:

XE
9 = 0.093 ± 0.011.
E
9 (2.6-2)

We note that the CLEO and ARGUS XE
9 E
9 measurements, quoted in the first part of
Table VI, are spread out by the considerable differences of the theoretical models
available at that time. On the contrary, the theoretical uncertainties connected to our
estimation (2.6-2) of the XE
9 E
9 ratio are at the level of few percent71. Therefore, we
can use this value to reject, by means of a 2 test, the models which give conflicting
predictions. The 2 values indicating the compatibility with the reference value 2.6-2,
2(KS)=9.4, 2(WSB)=6.9, 2(ACCMM)=2.4, 2(ISGW)=24,
(with 3 degrees of freedom) induce to reject the KS and IGSW models at the 5% level and
to recover the WSB and ACCMM predictions. In particular, the ACCMM model, which is
also able to reproduce a good agreement between the three measurements (the 2 of the
average is 2.5, see Table VI), leads to the following average determination:

XE
9 = 0.088 ± 0.009,

The mixing and CP violating phenomena are directly related to the existence of new
physics. If the d, s and b quarks were allowed to couple with the members of a fourth
quark family (or with another unknown species of heavy fermions) or a different kind of
highly massive gauge bosons could replace the exchanged ±
W , new, significant
contributions would have to be expected in the description of these processes. A
common property of the weak transitions of which these observables are characteristic
parameters is the ability to change the flavour of the quarks involved without changing
their charge (effective FCNC processes). The corresponding amplitudes can be obtained,
within the Standard Model, by iterating the basic, charged-current weak couplings. In
this way, the S= 2 and/or B= 2 transitions on which the mixing phenomena of neutral
mesons are based, are traced back to the elementary S= 1 and B= 1 processes, which
are represented by single CKM matrix elements. The description of mixing by means of
the so-called `box' diagrams (see Figure 4), in which two virtual ±
W bosons are
exchanged between two quark lines, cannot lead to a quantification of the transition
amplitudes without the additional assumption that only three quark families exist. The
hypothesis of the 3×3 unitarity of the CKM matrix, which has not been used for the
deduction of the elements of the first two rows, plays an essential role in the
measurement of the elements of the third row, even if it not imposed as a direct
constraint.

2.7.2 Lattice QCD results

Some recent lattice computations of heavy meson decay constants and bag factors are
shown in Table IX and X. The large systematic errors are due to several types of
approximations. For example, the results have been obtained on a finite space-time lattice
and therefore are dependent on the lattice spacing. Moreover, the bag factors have been
computed in a renormalization scheme which is peculiar to the lattice gauge theory, and

have to be converted using a continuum renormalization scheme (such as the MS
scheme), within which the experimental data are analysed. The extreme SU(3) symmetry,
often assumed for the light quarks, and the use of perturbative techniques are two other
sources of uncertainty which the systematic errors usually account for. On the other hand,
the evaluation of the consequences of the so-called quenched approximation is still at a
preliminary stage. In this approximation, which is common to all the computations, the
contribution of the sea quarks in closed loops is neglected, leading to a substantial
reduction in computing time. However, only the MILC collaboration106 has performed an
estimation of the resulting systematic errors; moreover, its investigation of quenching
effects was limited to a very simplified case107, in which only two quark flavours were
considered and the extrapolations to the physical masses and to the continuum were
omitted. While the theoretical panorama is still evolving, at present a truly reliable
estimate of the uncertainties on the currently available results cannot be given.






* The correlation between two measurements can obviously be eliminated if the margin of error
corresponding to the 100% confidence level is assumed for one of them. The error in the
determination of f does not increase if that for V (already corresponding to a 90% confidence
Ds cs

level) is rescaled by a factor of 25.

Table IX. ­ Recent lattice QCD results for the heavy-meson decay constants. The errors reflect many different causes of systematic
uncertainties which are inherent in lattice QCD calculations. However, their evaluation is incomplete in almost all cases. In particular,
the effects of the quenched approximation, in which only the valence quark contribution is taken into account, has not been estimated
except for a partial evaluation by the authors of Ref. 106 (see the last error quoted). Moreover, some results are still preliminary. Where
direct determinations are not available, the values of f f and f f obtained by combining the results listed in the same row are

confirm the evaluation of the quenching errors made by MILC. Using the experimental

The CP violation measured by the parameter corresponds to an asymmetry in

K

involves the dynamics of S= 1 decays and thus has not the same effect on the two
channels. This asymmetry is accounted for by the different way in which
+- and 00
are dependent on . According to a class of models which refer to Wolfenstein's125
K

`superweak' theory, the observable CP asymmetry of neutral kaon decays should arise
from the S= 2 sector alone: therefore would vanish, the equality +- = 00 =
K K
would apply and the CP violation observed in 0 0 + -

L
entirely attributed to a CP-even component already present in the initial state K (thus
L

q p 1; q p is not independent of the global phase-convention of the states K and

0

The superweak theory has been unequivocally contradicted by the recent
preliminary results of the KteV and NA48 experiments: the new measurements of the
ratio Re are incompatible with the value at a virtually 100%

It has often been argued130 that a value of greater than 210-3 cannot be
K K

accounted for within the present model of CP violation based on a single complex phase

in the CKM matrix. In actual fact, the evidence for direct CP violation is the only
straightforward, unambiguous conclusion which can be drawn from the experimental
result, while, at present, large theoretical uncertainties affect the Standard Model
computations of the magnitude of the CP-violating effect. Most computed values (see
Table XII) are consistent with a lower value than the measured one. However, they are
strongly dependent on the strange quark mass (roughly 2
m ), of which the
K K 1 s

most recent estimates, based on lattice-QCD calculations, give much lower values than
before. The Standard Model prediction is summarized by the following expression:131

2.7.6 b s penguin decays

The first observation of the bs electromagnetic penguin decays (see Figure 6),
performed by CLEO146, consisted in the identification of the exclusive channel
B
K (892
) . The measured decay rate of this process cannot be used to extract
accurate information about the weak coupling of the quarks involved in the interaction,
because of major theoretical uncertainties in the description of the hadronization process.
Recently, CLEO and ALEPH have carried out independent measurements of the
inclusive branching ratio 7 (b X , providing quite a reliable way of constraining
s )

the CKM matrix elements V and V . The Standard Model prediction, normalized to

2.8 Summary


The best values obtained so far in the present work for the CKM matrix elements
are listed in Table XIII, where they are compared to those quoted by the Particle Data
Group (updated in January, 1998).
In most cases, a reduction in the experimental uncertainties has been obtained by
taking into account the most recent measurements. For example, data from deep inelastic
scattering of neutrinos on nucleons and from hadronic ±
W decays have been included in
the V average, leading to a reduction by a factor of 7 in the final uncertainty. A
cs

significant improvement has also been achieved in the determination of V V , since
ub cb

new, independent measurements of V and V V have made it possible to
ub ub cb

discriminate between the disagreeing theoretical predictions which were used in the end-
point inclusive analyses of non-charmed B decays.
In other cases, the determinations of the matrix elements have not changed
considerably; however, all the values obtained are the result of a detailed re-analysis of
the available information, in which the relevant experimental parameters have been
updated to the most recent world averages.

3 An up-to-date profile of the unitarity triangle

As far as possible, all the experimental information collected in the previous Section
has been treated in such a way that any correlation among the single determinations has
been avoided or reduced to a negligible level. As a result, a set of independent
constraints on the CKM matrix elements has been outlined. In this Section, we refine the
determination of the CKM matrix and obtain estimates for other parameters of physical
interest by imposing all these constraints simultaneously and requiring explicitly that the
three-family unitarity condition of the matrix be satisfied. This further constraint is
imposed (together with the removal of the non-physical complex phases) by expressing
the matrix elements in terms of a four-variable parametrization (either Wolfenstein's or
the canonical parametrization). The number of independent constraints which is needed
to make the problem completely determined is then exceeded by a wide margin.
Therefore, the precision in the values of the CKM matrix elements can be improved
considerably with respect to those obtained from direct measurements. At the same time,
the unitarity triangle, which represents one of the unitarity relations on the complex
plane, can be determined, and the magnitudes of the CP asymmetries in B decays can be
evaluated.
Two different methods are followed independently for the overall determination of the
CKM matrix and the unitarity triangle. The first procedure, a 2-minimization, is
discussed in Sect. 3. 1 and the results are reported in Sect. 3. 3. A number of additional
trials is also performed, in which the principal constraints are removed in turn to show
how they affect the results. In Sect. 3. 2 the information which is effective in
constraining the position of the vertex of the unitarity triangle is represented
geometrically on the (, ) plane using Wolfenstein's parametrization. An account of
the second method, based on Bayesian statistics, and the results obtained from its
application are presented in Sect. 3. 4. Finally, in Sect. 3. 5 the impact of the
forthcoming experiments at the B factories is evaluated, and the importance they have as
essential instruments for the verification of the Standard Model is emphasized.




3.1 Description of the fit procedure


The information used in the present analysis to constrain the CKM matrix is
summarized in Table XIV. The matrix elements have been expressed in terms of
Wolfenstein's unitary parametrization. Each term has been calculated up to the fourth
order in . For this purpose, the expansion of V has been extended further than in
CKM

Eq. (1. 1-7), considering the real and the imaginary parts separately. While it is true that
a fourth-order computation is not justified by the present degree of precision of the data,
future improvements in the theoretical and experimental uncertainties will increase the
sensitivity of the results to the accuracy of these computations. For example, the fourth-
order correction is already comparable to the magnitude of the error in the case of V
ud

and it would not even be possible to use the direct measurement of V as a constraint if
tb

the expansion were truncated at the second order.

3.2 Constraints on the unitarity triangle in Wolfenstein's
parametrization.


One of the advantages in the use of Wolfenstein's parametrization is that the
effectiveness of a constraint can be estimated at first sight. In fact, the present status of
the uncertainties is such that some constraints are almost ineffective in comparison with
the much stronger requirement of unitarity. For example, the ( 5
) term of
4
2
V = 1- A (1- 2) ,
(3. 2-1)
cd
2
i. e. the fourth-order correction in the magnitude of the matrix element, is completely
negligible compared to the experimental error. Therefore, the measurement of V and
cd

that of 7
V = + ( ) impose essentially the same constraint on the parameter , but
us

the former is six times less precise and thus insignificant. Analogously, V , V and
cs tb
2 2 2 2
V V V differ from unity by ( ) terms (see Table XIV), which can be
ts tb cb

neglected given the comparatively low precision of the measurements. The error in V
ud

is probably just below the level of precision which would make the constraint useful.

However, the `measurement' of m

The way in which the constraints applied to the CKM matrix define an allowed region

3.3 Results


The complete solution of the fit is given in Table XVI (CKM parameters and matrix
elements) and Table XVII (output values of the additional parameters). The most
probable shape of the unitarity triangle and the contours of the 68 and 95% confidence
regions for the vertex (, ) are shown in Figure 8.
The maximum-likelihood estimates of , , sin2, sin2, = , ,
13 12 23 and 13
have been obtained by repeating the minimization with the use of different
parametrizations. Wolfenstein's parameters and can be replaced by the coordinates

, of the vertex of the unitarity triangle using the one-to-one relations (1. 2-6). A

choice between several non-equivalent ways of inverting the relations (1. 2-8) has to be
made in order to express the parametrization in terms of sin2 and sin2. In fact, while
and can be placed into one-to-one correspondence with tan and tan
tan(-- ),

hold. This choice is also supported a posteriori, for the minimum 2 and the output
values of all other parameters are the same as those yielded by the primary fit. When the
constraint equations are expressed in terms of the canonical parametrization (1-3), the
values of the three Euler angles , , and the phase = are obtained as a
12 23 13 13
result of the fit. An alternative possibility of estimating the angle is given by Eqs. (3.3-
1) and (3. 3-3), from which and can be extracted as functions of sin2, or
sin2, . The results are displayed in Figure 8 in terms of three different couples of
parameters.

The constraints have in turn been released by subtracting the corresponding terms
from the total 2. In this way, the influence of each single constraint on the
determination of the unitarity triangle has been ascertained. The most significant results
are listed in Table XVIII. The way in which the confidence regions for (
, ) vary in

the four most interesting cases can be seen in Figure 9.

It should be noted that, even when the only constraint which is based on the present
experimental evidence for CP violation, namely the measurement of , is released, it
K

is unequivocally predicted that the observables parametrizing the magnitude of CP
violation ( , , sin2 ) assume non-zero values. (The measurement of sin2 is not
incompatible with the absence of CP-violating effects and, given its precision, has no
influence on the results). The current precision in the determination of the phase is
almost entirely due to the much more effective V V and V constraints: when
ub cb ub

these are removed, the error in sin2, for example, is nearly tripled. However, the
imaginary part of the CKM matrix becomes totally undetermined after the removal of all
constraints the theoretical interpretation of which assumes the dominant contribution of
the top quark in the virtual intermediate state of the S= 2 and/or B= 2 processes. On
the other hand, it is evident that the remaining constraints (the direct measurements of

the moduli V except V ) cannot be used to confine the domain of the vertex of the
ij tb

unitarity triangle to any definite region, except for a spherically symmetrical area around
the origin ( V V and V ).

As expected, the results have proved to be nearly or completely insensitive to the

It is not clear to what extent the minimum 2 value can be interpreted as an estimate
of the goodness-of-fit. The contribution of non-Gaussian uncertainties should be taken
into account. Moreover, the ineffective constraints should reasonably not be numbered
among the degrees of freedom of the fit. Whatever its exact statistical interpretation, the
small 2 value (=2.6 unnormalized) obtained in the fit with all the constraints, is the
clear sign of a high degree of consistency in the experimental data and between the data
and the model.

The purely theoretical determinations of the bag parameters clearly have considerable
weight, although this is not evident when the corresponding constraints are released one
at a time (the cause may be found in the strong correlation between the constraints
m , m and ). In particular, both B and the -coordinate of the vertex (the
B B K B
d s

two parameters are highly correlated) are determined with much less precision when
only the `experimental' constraints are used.
On the other hand, a significant increase in the precision of the results will not be
achieved by reducing the theoretical errors in B and B , unless a general
B K

improvement in the level of the uncertainties is obtained (particularly in the quark
masses, which occur in the factor S (x , x , and in the decay constants). The values of

Our results for the CKM parameters and for the vertex of the unitarity triangle are

techniques but different sets of experimental data.




3.4 Bayesian determination of the CKM matrix

To have an estimate of the goodness of the values obtained with the 2 minimization
method and obtain the probability distribution functions (p. d. f. ) of the CKM elements
and of all the estimated quantities, a complementary method153, based on Bayesian
statistics154, has been applied to the data set of Table XIV. This method has the
considerable advantage that it keeps track of all the assumptions made from beginning to
end, whereas other methods usually do not. For example, the standard 2-minimization
method starts from the assumption that all the input values are Gaussian-distributed and
provide estimates that are assumed to be Gaussian-distributed. This is reliable only at a
first approximation, since the asymmetric errors and the shapes of the maximum
probability regions clearly indicate that at least some quantities depart from Gaussianity.
The Bayesian approach for the statistic estimations starts from the definition of a set of
parameters ( x ) with a prior probability P(x,i) and a set of experimental data e with a
probability distribution function P(e, x | i), which depends on the x parameters. If x is
a set of continuous variables, their final (`posterior') probability distribution function is
given by
, | × ,
P(x,i | e) P(e x i) P(x i)
= . (3. 4-1)
P(e, x | i) P(x,i) x
d
×



61


Hence, if an initial probability distribution for certain variables ( x ) is used and new
experimental data are expressed by P(e, x | i), from Eq. (3.4-1) we get a new
distribution of probability for the initial variables (the posterior p. d. f. ). From the shape
of this distribution, the best estimations or the allowed ranges of the starting variables
can be extracted. The prior p. d. f. P(x,i) and the allowed range for x are generally a
matter of assumption. As long as the P(e, x | i) function contains more information than
the prior p. d. f. , these assumptions do not play any role in the final results155.
Eq. (3. 4-1) can be used to estimate the p. d. f. of the CKM elements. To allow the
comparison with the 2 minimization method, we consider exactly the same experimental
data set (Table XIV). Therefore, in e we consider the quantities V , V , V , V ,

parameters only, and the quantities , m

experimental or theoretical parameters. These parameter dependencies fix the set of the
x quantities. Concerning the CKM parameters, we take the four angles that define
completely a unitarized three-family CKM matrix (Eq. 1. 1-3): = ( , , , .

The parameter space is given by all the allowed space, that is [ ,

For the prior distribution P( ,

a uniform distribution in the allowed space. As is customary in the Bayesian method,
this general and weak assumption has no (or weak) effect on the final result154. As far as

For the expression of the probability distribution function P(e, x | i) which enters in Eq.
(3. 4-1), it is possible to take advantage of the fact that all the measurements in the set e
are independent. Therefore, we use:

P(e, x | i)= P µ , x | i
(3. 4-6)
i ( X i )
i

where the product runs over all the measurements considered and P are their
i

probabilities. These are given by the Gaussian distribution functions, associated to the
µX measured values, times an interval value X
:

The P µ , | written in this way represents the probability to measure X in an interval
i ( x i
X )
[µ ,µ + X
when the mean value and the standard deviation of the Gaussian
X X ]
distribution are given by X (x) and . The actual choice of the interval width X is
X

not relevant since, when P(e, x | i) is built and substituted into Eq. (3.4-1), all the X
i
cancel out in the ratio. Apart from these X
terms, P(e, x | i) has the structure of a
i

likelihood.
For the posterior probability function P(x,i | e), we can calculate the probability
distribution of any variable z which is a function of x , z = f (x), by means of the
following relation:
P(z,i | ) d
e = (z - f (x))P(x,i | e) d
x
d = P(x,i | e)
(3. 4-9)
z > f (x ) x
d
dz dz
where the integral must be evaluated in all the allowed space and (x) is the usual
Heavyside function, that is 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0.
In order to obtain the p. d. f. for any quantity z which we are interested in using Eq.
(3. 4-9), we applied extensively the Monte Carlo method for the integral evaluation,
generating a sample of 9
10 points in the x space with a probability distribution given
by the P(x,i).
The p. d. f. for the most important quantities, which are evaluated simultaneously,
are shown in Figures 10-13. As can be seen in Figure 10, the three angles can vary
ij

in a rather small range and have an approximate Gaussian distribution, whereas the




63


phase can vary in a much wider range and it is clearly not Gaussian-distributed. The
13

p. d. fs. for sin2, sin2, m
and the vertex of the unitarity triangle are shown in
Bs

Figure 11 and Figure 13. They have a marked non-Gaussian behaviour, which is
particularly evident in the shape of sin2. The p.d.f. for the moduli of the CKM
elements are shown in Figure 12. As it can be seen, the elements V , V , V and
cb td ts

V are clearly not Gaussian-distributed.

In Table XXII, we present the complete result of this method for comparison with
the one obtained with the 2-minimization method (Table XVI). As Bayesian estimators
of the p. d. f. parameters, we take the mean and root mean square of the relative p. d. f. .
The comparison with the results given in Table XVI shows a good agreement on all data
within one sigma. As expected, the biggest differences can be observed on the variables
having the clearest non-Gaussian behaviour, for which the Bayesian estimation of the
root mean square gives always a bigger value. As regards the 95% limits, since these
are mainly determined by the properties of the p. d. f. tails (which are assumed to be
Gaussian in the 2 method) the Bayesian estimation always favour wider intervals. The
95% regions quoted are central-interval estimates, computed as in the previous analysis
of Ref. 153.

3.5 New prospects

According to the experimental results concerning kaon decays, a single complex
phase in the CKM matrix seems a suitable explanation for CP violation. On the other
hand, insofar as the baryon number of the universe has to be considered as a
dynamically generated quantity rather than an initial condition, the Standard Model fails
to account for the present abundance of matter by several orders of magnitude156. The
measurement of the CP-violating phenomena which are expected to occur in heavier
quark sectors will provide an independent way of testing the present theoretical
knowledge. The study of B mesons, which are ten times heavier than kaons and thus
undergo a wide range of (mostly rare) decays, seems to be an almost ideal field of
research. Large CP asymmetries are predicted to occur in the decays of B mesons and




68


the experiments will have many possibilities of revealing the presence of new physics.
The measurement of CP violation in the b quark sector will be the subject of an intense
activity in the so-called B factories after 2000.
A quite clear strategy can be adopted in the measurement of sin2. The already
mentioned CP asymmetry (1-17) which is expected in the rates of 0 0
B B J K
d d S

decays will be measured either as an oscillating function of time, whose amplitude is
equal to sin2, or by integration over a definite interval of time.
The extraction of sin2 from the measurement of the asymmetry

d )-( 0 + -

a + - = (2. 4-1)
( 0 + -

is less straightforward, since `tree' and `penguin' amplitudes interfere with different
weak and strong phases in 0 0 + -

ratio measurements in order to eliminate the hadronic uncertainties which are introduced
by a phase difference between tree and penguin amplitudes.

A distinction can be made between the experiments at the hadronic machines
(HERA-B, CDF, LHCb) and those exploiting the B production induced by
electromagnetic interactions between colliding +
e and -
e (BaBar and Belle). While the
experiments in the first class can detect the production of b
b couples with a high cross-
section, but with a low signal-to-background ratio, a low cross-section is expected
BB

at the electromagnetic B factories, which, on the other hand, will be operating in a frame
of quite a few background events.
The measurement of the 0 0
B B oscillation frequency m
is within reach of the
s - s Bs
hadronic B factories only. The chances of success of each experiment are restricted by
the maximum time resolution it can achieve, which imposes an upper limit on the

already provide an estimate of the limits beyond which the new measurements will have
to be definitely interpreted as signals of new physics. For example, the prediction for
sin2 is precise enough to define a wide range of values which the Standard Model
would be unable to account for, even within the `physical' range [0,1].
The most general supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the Standard Model would
be able to change the expected shape of the unitarity triangle (the existence of only three
generations of particles is not called into question) in quite an unpredictable way, due to
the contribution of new, presently unconstrained phases. Some restrictive assumptions
have to be made in order to give a quantitative account of the possible modifications of
the present scenario, as allowed by the currently available experimental data. In the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its several variants (see Ref. 152
for a recent review), the flavour­changing processes are controlled by essentially the
same mixing matrix (V ) as in the Standard Model. The direct measurements of the
CKM

CKM matrix elements are not affected by these theories, while the contribution of the
supersymmetric particles to the effective FCNC processes (B-meson and K-meson
mixing) can be parametrized by adding a `supersymmetric' term to the top-quark loop

function in the expressions of m
, m and . Equations (1. 7-7), (1. 7-8) and

between the models already in the first years of running of the experiments.

Conclusions

An intensive program for the study of CP violation in weak decays involving the b-
quark is about to be carried on by dedicated experiments. Only indirect estimates can be
given at present for the magnitude of these phenomena; moreover, they are obtained in
the framework of a critical sector of the Standard Model, the one describing the flavour-
changing processes and parametrized by the CKM matrix, the verification of which
offers the most favourable prospects for the discovery of new physics. With the aim of
setting the status of the present knowledge about the CKM matrix before the start of the
new experimental venture, a detailed and comprehensive review of the theoretical and
experimental information until now available in this field has been presented.
A great amount of precise information, obtained in some cases by exploiting new
experimental sources, has been made available by the exceptionally thriving activity of
the experiments in the very last years, leading in some cases to a noticeable
improvement in the direct determination of the CKM matrix elements. For example, the
precise measurement of W± hadronic decays can be translated into a determination of the
element V being a factor of 6 more precise than the former best value derived from
cs

the analysis of D semileptonic decays. Moreover, thanks to a new measurement of the
size of the nucleon strange-quark sea, it has been possible to extract a value for V
cs

from the neutrino-nucleon scattering data. Especially valuable information comes from
the recent progress in the observation of B decays. More stringent constraints on V
td

and (in the form of a lower limit) V are now provided by the study of 0 0
B - B and
ts d d

0 0
B - B oscillations, while the first determination of V has been made possible by
s s ts

new measurements and accurate theoretical calculations of the b s decay rate.
Furthermore, new or recently improved measurements of B semileptonic decays have
led to better determinations of V , V and V V .
ub cb ub cb

Both the latest measurements and earlier (but not always unproblematic) results have
been critically reviewed in the present work, calling attention to the least clearly defined
experimental situations and pointing out the main theoretical uncertainties and questions.
Among the results obtained, the theoretical uncertainty on the earliest experimental
determinations of V V has been reduced by exploiting the results of the recent
ub cb

measurements of V , V and V V to discriminate between the disagreeing
ub cb ub cb

predictions of different models. The resulting information provides at present the most
effective constraint on the values of the imaginary part of the CKM matrix and of the
CP-violating parameters.
A set of independent constraints has then been defined on the basis of the collected
information. The unitarity condition of the 3×3 CKM matrix has been imposed as a
further constraint by expressing each quantity in terms of either Wolfenstein's or the
canonical parametrization. With the explicit assumption of unitarity, an over-determined
problem is obtained, the solution of which gives much more precise values for the
matrix elements; at the same time, other quantities of physical interest, such as the
angles of the unitarity triangle and the B -oscillation parameter, can be determined.
s





74


Two independent procedures have been followed, consisting respectively in a 2-
minimization and in a more refined approach based on Bayesian statistics. The results
obtained from the application of the two methods are in good agreement and, in some
cases, constitute a great improvement with respect to the direct experimental
determinations of the CKM elements. For example, the errors in V and V are
cd cs

reduced respectively by factors of 6 and 8, while the precision on V is increased by 4
tb

orders of magnitude. The probability distribution functions of the CKM elements and of
all other relevant parameters are obtained as a result of the Bayesian determination.
Highly asymmetric distributions are found for some quantities, such as the angles of the
unitarity triangle, indicating that a complete description of the final knowledge of these
parameters cannot be given if a simple confidence interval is quoted, as in the results of
the 2 minimization. On the other hand, the 2 method has the advantage of providing a
measure of the compatibility between the data and the model. The low 2 value at the
minimum denotes a high degree of consistency between the experimental data and the
description of the CP violating phenomena considered inside the Standard Model.
The following predictions concerning the physics of B-meson decays have been
obtained:

They indicate with absolute certainty the presence of CP violation in B decays according
to the Standard Model. Moreover, this conclusion is independent of the experimental
evidence for the parallel phenomenon already observed in the kaon system, since the
removal of the constraint does not alter significantly the results.
K

The above-mentioned results constitute the reference values to which the direct CP-
violation and 0
B -mixing measurements will have to be compared in the search for new
s

physics. On the other hand, their constraining effect on at least one class of minimal
extensions of the Standard Model is still rather weak. In fact, the predictions of the
Standard Model and those of its Minimal Supersymmetric extensions are at present
nearly indistinguishable. However, as it has been shown in the last Section of this work,
the direct measurements of CP violation expected in the first years of running of the B
factories should already be able to bring the knowledge of the unitarity triangle to a
substantially higher level of precision, offering the chance of detecting even the smallest
non-Standard-Model effects.
