The method of quasi-optimal observables  offers a fundamental yet simple and flexible algorithmic
framework for data processing in high energy physics to improve upon the practice of event selection cuts.

short of reformulating the estimation procedure in terms of the
method of moments. As a kind of test of whether or not ref. [13]
crossed the discovery line, I note the following: Whereas it would
have been immediate to make use of the result of [12] in my work
on jet observables [14] (and it would have saved me a lot of trou-
ble then and later, even if the result is not general), it would be
hardly possible to make a similar use of [13]; also, the problem
was formulated in [12] in such a way that I can easily imagine my-
self replacing the derivation of [12] with the more general one [1]
to arrive at the general result (4), but I cannot imagine ref. [13] as
such a starting point.
An extension to several parameters, and with inclusion of quad-
ratic terms (within the ideological framework of [12]) was pre-
sented and systematically studied in [15], including the connection
with the FFRC inequality [16]. It resulted in a body of work on
measurement of (anomalous) trilinear couplings (e.g. [17], [18]).
A generalization similar to that of [15] was achieved in [19].
Note that if the dependence on the parameter being estimated is
essentially non-linear (as would be the case e.g. with masses, de-
cay widths, etc.), the general formulae (4) and (9) have to be in-
voked.
It is rather amusing that the citations of [12], [15], [19] are
strongly correlated with the keywords "CP violation", "trilinear
gauge couplings", "anomalous three gauge boson couplings".
The corresponding community seems to have no appreciable inter-
section with that specializing in jet algorithms or in the construc-
tion of cuts using complicated algorithmic machinery (as repre-
sented e.g. at the ACAT/AIHENP workshops).
Still, I find it strange that little, if any, effort seems to have been
expended to decouple the results of refs. [12], [15], [19] from the
rather special physical problematics and to make them known be-
yond the community of weak-couplings specialists, as those for-
mulae deserved.
