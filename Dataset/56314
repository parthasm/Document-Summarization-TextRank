Abstract

The main features of the observables in the SNO and Super-Kamiokande solar
neutrino experiments in the case of neutrino spin and/or spin-flavour precession
in the magnetic field of the sun are discussed. It is shown without any model
dependent assumption that in the case of Majorana transition magnetic moments the
NC event rate does not depend on time and a measurement of will allow
(0)21 (3)41





to determine the initial flux of neutrinos with a theoretical uncertainty of a few
576





%. In the case of Dirac magnetic moments the NC event rate will depend on time
 2 Dec 1993 and we obtain a model independent lower bound for the transition probability of
initial 's into right-handed sterile neutrinos.

1 Introduction

It was shown in ref.[1, 2, 3] that future real-time solar neutrino experiments (SNO [4] and
others), in which high-energy neutrinos from decay will be detected through the observation
5

6





of different reactions, will allow to separate the investigation of neutrino properties (masses,
mixing, etc.) from the investigation of the central invisible region of the sun in which energy is
generated.
If only active neutrinos are present in the solar neutrino flux on the earth, the initial flux of
neutrinos and the survival probability can be determined directly from the data of future
5 6 8&9





solar neutrino experiments without any assumption about the mechanism of transition of into
8¤9





and/or . In the general case of neutrino mixing, solar 's can transfer into active neutrinos
¡





8 8£¢ 8 9





, , and into sterile left-handed (anti)neutrinos (see ref.[5]). Different model independent
¡





8&9 8 8£¢





relations and inequalities between observables, which could allow to reveal whether there are
sterile neutrinos in the flux of solar neutrinos on the earth, were derived in ref.[3].
In this paper we will discuss possibilities of a model independent treatment of the data from
future solar neutrino experiments in the case of spin and/or spin-flavour precession of solar 's
8 9





due to anomalously large neutrino magnetic moments. The effects of neutrino magnetic moments
[6, 7] were widely discussed in last years (see ref.[8]) in connection with a possible indication of
the existence of an anticorrelation between the flux of solar 's and the sunspot number [9].

The possible transitions of neutrinos in the magnetic field of the sun depend on the nature of
neutrinos. In the case of Dirac neutrinos, solar 's can be transformed into sterile right-handed

If it will occur that the CC event rate depends on time periodically, it will be an evidence that
neutrinos have large magnetic moments and their effects are important. In this paper we discuss
which additional informations can be extracted from a measurement of the NC and ES event rates
through the observation of the processes (2) and (3), respectively. In particular, we will show
that through the observation of the NC and ES reactions it will be possible to distinguish Dirac
from Majorana magnetic moments.

5 Conclusions

In SNO, Super-Kamiokande and other future solar neutrino experiments high energy solar neutri-



nos will be detected through the observation of CC, NC and ES ( - elastic scattering) reactions.

If neutrinos have large (Majorana or Dirac) magnetic moments, solar neutrinos can undergo spin
and/or spin-flavour precessions in the magnetic field of the sun. In this case the CC event rate
will manifest a periodical time dependence.
We have shown that in the case of Majorana neutrino magnetic moments the NC event rate
in the SNO experiment ( ) will not depend on time and a measurement of will allow to
( )21 ( )41





7


determine in a model independent way the total flux of initial neutrinos (see Eq.(15)) and the
5 6





survival probability (see Eq.(16)). In the case of Majorana neutrino magnetic moments the
9
8





ES event rates will depend on time. We have shown, however, that a combination of ES and CC







event rates ( ! , see Eq.(20)) can have only a minor time dependence. We have also shown that,
in the case of Majorana neutrino magnetic moments, there is a relation between the NC, CC and
ES event rates (Eq.(28)).
In the case of Dirac neutrino magnetic moments the NC event rate in the SNO experiment,
as well as the CC and ES event rates, will depend on time. We have shown that a measurement
of the NC (or ES) and CC event rates will allow to determine a (time dependent) lower bound
for the average transition probability of solar 's into all possible right-handed sterile states (see
8 9





Eq.(18) and Eq.(31)).
Finally, for the case of Majorana magnetic moments we have derived an expression that
allows to obtain the average probability of the transition of initial 's into and/or from
¡





8 9 8 8
£¢





measurable quantities (see Eq.(38)). The determination of this average probability will require a
measurement of the event rates with rather high accuracy.
