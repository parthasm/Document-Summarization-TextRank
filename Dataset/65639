We study the dynamical equations for two-family neutrino
oscillations in a medium of continuously-varying density.
We can find explicit solutions to these equations in terms of
series of nested integrals. These solutions can serve as a
basis for numerical calculation of these processes or for
further study of their analytical properties.

I. Introduction

The presence of neutrino oscillations [1-2] has renewed interest in the question of
oscillations within matter [3-5]. The early work ("MSW") of Refs. 3 and 4 solved the
problem of propagation within a medium of constant density, and it is possible to treat
nonconstant density by numerical means. It is nevertheless always useful to think about
an analytic approach [6] in order to develop insight and understanding. Since the case we
study here is that of a two-channel problem, some aspects of the methods we describe are
also applicable to spins in varying magnetic fields and other two-channel order-
dependent problems.
For convenience we recall here the MSW results [3, 4], constant density We
assume a two-channel approximation to neutrino mixing and give the amplitude T(t) for a
neutrino beam of energy E passing through a medium of constant electron density Ne
given some initial neutrino flavor mixture (0), namely
(t) = T(t)(0). (1.1)
(The time t can be interchangably viewed as the thickness x of the medium.) Here the


two-vector weak state (i.e., flavor basis) is ( ) e
t = . The transition amplitude T is
µ
T = cos + i sin cos (2 ) - i sinsin (2 (1.2)

where the primed variables contain the effect of the matter:

The mass parameter m2 = m 2 2 2
2 - m1 , where mi is the ith mass eigenvalue, is positive. We
recover the vacuum result, Cabibbo angle , for A = 0.
This introduction sets some notation and recalls well-known results. Below we
shall be concerned with variable density.

II. Passage through a medium of variable density

The Schrödinger equation for a two-family weak state (t) propagating through a
medium of electron density Ne is

where, using the approximation mi << E and after pieces in the hamiltonian proportional
to the unit matrix are removedthey lead only to overall phases, as we describe further

A solution to Eq. (2.1) will give us the amplitude T(t), through Eq. (1.1).
It is convenient to approach the dynamical equation (2.1) by starting in the mass
basis, using the transformed states
V . We do so by multiplying Eq. (2.1) by
V ,
giving
d
i = (
H +V WV . (2.5)
D )
dt
Next we remove the factor HD by defining a new function by
-iHDt
e .
Starting from Eq. (2.5) it is easy to see that this function obeys the equation
d
iH t -
D iHDt
i = e V WVe . (2.6)
dt
In this expression, only the mass difference enters into the exponentials. To see this,
define
2 2 2
m + m m
1 2
E E + and
- . (2.7)
4E 4E
In terms of these quantities, HD reads
H = E +
D 3

The portion of HD proportional to the unit matrix commutes through the quantities in Eq.
(2.6) and cancels, leaving
d

3t i 3t
i = e V WVe . (2.8)

We next write out in 2 × 2 form the quantity multiplying on the right side of Eq.
(2.8), using in particular the identity

In the last step we have taken out the piece proportional to the unit matrix; again, it
contributes only an overall phase to . (This can be seen in a variety of ways. For
t

example, one can define a new function exp + A
(t)dt and show that the
2
0
equation for is identical to that for but with the last form in Eq. (2.10) on the right
multiplying .) We can finally transform away the term in Eq. (2.10) proportional to 3.
We define the new function by

P(t) .
The last line defines the matrix P(t), in terms of which we can write our formal solution
to this equation. We remark in particular, for later use, that the 21 element P21 equals the
complex conjugate of the 12 element P12. We will below express the solution to Eq.
(2.13) in terms of P12 and P12*.
The form that P(t) takes is easy to understand. The central matrix in the first line
i
± I cos2
3
of Eq. (2.13) is a linear combination of 2
1 and 2, while the external factors e
take the form of a rotation about the 3-axis. Their effect is then to rotate the combination
of 1 and 2 to give a different combination that lies at a different anglethat takes the
form of the original combination but with the phase shifted. This is indeed what happens,
as the explicit calculations that give us P(t) show.

Solution of the equation for
. It is clear from the matrix structure of Eq. (2.13) that the
commutator [P(t), P(t)] 0, so that the solution to Eq. (2.13) involves an ordering.
Formally, the solution is
t

(t ) = exp i
- P
(s)ds (0) M (t) (0), (2.14a)

0
where the time ordering operator
ensures that the matrices P in the expression are
ordered so that P with a later argument stands to the left of P with an earlier argument.
We may write
n t t t

-
M (t) ( )
= ds ds ds
P s P s P s

1 2 n ( 1) ( 2 ) ( n )

and it is a standard exercise to show that this is equivalent to

Finally we can separate out the explicit matrix elements of M by using the matrix
structure of P, namely P(t) = Px(t)1 + Py(t)2. This leads immediately to

Alternatively, direct differentiation of the group of Eqs. (2.15) shows that it satisfies the

The solution given by Eqs. (2.15) is essentially a power series in A. The order
dependence of the result is contained in the fact that the integrals in M are nested. We can
write the transition amplitude T in terms of M by undoing our series of transformations,
leaving

Generally speaking the nested integrals in M are complicated, even for the case of
constant density. (Of course numerical integration is always possible.)

III. Second order equation

Equation (2.13) represents two coupled first order differential equations. These equations
can be rewritten as a single uncoupled second order equation, and the second order

already expressed. In terms of the explicit components of , Eq. (2.13) reads

where
-iP12 and -iP21 = -iP12*. (3.2)

One more derivative of, say, the upper component gives = + =

Using the explicit expressions for and , we find that
2

A 2
Thus we have finally the second order equation
2
A

- + i 2 + Acos 2 + Asin 2 = 0 (3.4)

It is worthwhile noting that the quantity I, Eq. (2.12), does not appear in this equation.
We may take the required two boundary conditions to be
1(0) and 2(0) = (0) / (0) .

Once we find the solution for =
1(t), we have t . We also remark here
2 ( ) (t) dt
that we have verified that our formal solution to the equations for , Eq. (2.15), satisfies
Eq. (3.4).

Recovery of constant density case. For the MSW case (constant A A0), reviewed in
Section I, Eq. (3.4) takes the form

-ib + c = 0 (3.5)
1 0 1 0 1

where
1
b = 2 + A cos 2 and c = A sin 2 . (3.6)

If in addition we define

then the solution to this equation is

2 2 ( )[ 0 ] 0 1 ( )

2
1 1
C = 0 - b + c 0
2 2 ( )[ 0 ] 0 1 ( )

2
This solution allows us to identify M(t) through Eq. (2.14) and hence the
transition amplitude T through Eq. (2.16) adapted to constant A, namely
it
- ( it

The result of the exercise is

Then specific calculation shows, for example,
2i
T = T = sin 2 sin t / 2 . (3.11)

This can be put into the canonical form of Ref. [4], -i(sinm)(sin2m), where the subscript

Indeed, in terms of these new variables the full transition amplitude is

This is the full canonical form described in Section I for propagation in a medium of
constant density.

Adiabatic Expansion. If the factor in Eq. (3.4) that contains the derivative of A is small
compared to the other factors, one can make a systematic adiabatic expansion [6zz] in
terms of it about the 0th order (MSW) answer. To do so, it is useful to recast the solution
technique somewhat. We shall first take the starting point of the neutrino beam, at t = 0,
to specify the constant background level of the material density factor, i.e., A(0) = A0. We

leave the boundary conditions 1(0) and 2(0) unspecified for the moment but remark that
using Eq. (2.13) the boundary condition for 2(0) gives us alternatively a condition for the
d i
derivative of 1 = - = -

We see from our earlier solution of the constant density case (Eq. 3.8) that the t-
dependence is contained in a pair of phases. An alternative way to derive these phases in
the constant density case is through a solution ansatz of the schematic form
1 = R0 exp(iS0(t)), (3.14)
where R0 is constant and where S0(t = 0) = 0. The real and imaginary parts of Eq. (3.5)
lead to the following equations for S0(t):
2
dS dS
0 0 2
- b - c = 0
0 0
dt dt
(3.15)
2
d S0 = 0.
2
dt
Together with the vanishing of S0 at t = 0, these imply that
S0(t) = t (3.16)
where
2 2
- b - c = 0 (3.17)
0 0

The solution of the quadratic equation gives
1
= ± +
± (b ) 2 2

b 4c . (3.18)

Thus, as indeed Eq. (3.8) shows, a better ansatz for the solution is
i t i
+ t
t = R e + R e - (3.19)
1 ( ) + -

The boundary conditions for 1(t) give us immediately R+ + R- = 1(0) and
1
R + = -

R =

2 2
Having reviewed the 0th order (constant density) problem, we go on to include
time (distance) dependence in the material density. We accordingly write the input
density as
A(t) = A0(1 + f1(t)), (3.21)
where f1(t) << 1 for all t in the problem and f1(t 0) = 0. We extend our ansatz for the
solution to the form
(t) = R +
+ (t ) iS (t )
e + R
+ - (t ) iS (t )
e - , (3.22a)

where R = +

S = +

± ±
The quantities with subscript "1" are all small; moreover, 1 (0) = 1 (0) = 0. We also set
b(t) = b0 + b1(t), where b1(t) = A0 f1(t) cos2 (3.23a)
c(t) = c0 + c1(t), where c1(t) = (A0 f1(t) sin2)/2. (3.23b)

We now insert our ansatz into Eq. (3.5). The spirit of the adiabatic expansion is to keep
only first order terms in quantities with the subscript "1." In addition, we insist that the
coefficients of exp(iS±(t)) vanish separately.
The real and imaginary parts of the coefficients of exp(iS±) give respectively

namely v1 (0) = 0 = u1 (0). As we shall see, these boundary conditions guarantee that 1

We decouple the two equations for v1 and u1 by taking one more derivative of,

with, as causality suggests, G(x) = 0 for x < 0. The Green's function required is
