so that Eq. (15) coincides with the known FN values.

Optimal parametrization corresponds to

N
~ is used for checking on
the stability of the results and for numerical optimiza-
tion. In contrast to the 4 theory [1, 2], the common coef-
ficient in the asymptotic expression (10) is unknown. Fig. 1.
Technically, this is not a problem because the
parameter
A0 in Eq. (15) is not considered as known but
is found by interpolation. However, this leads to a much
greater uncertainty in the function FN; its first values (in
units of 10-3) F 2 = 63.1, F3 = ­7.02, F4 = 0.34, and F5 =
1.23 exhibit only a weak tendency to become a constant,
and the predicted value A0 = lim F changes by several

~ . At first glance,
no reasonable results can be obtained in such a situa-
tion.

However, the algorithm used for determining the
asymptotic form of (g) is, in a sense, "superstable":
the addition of an arbitrary mth-order polynomial
Pm(N) to BN does not change the coefficients UN at N
m + 2 [2]. This property can be generalized for a wide
class of smooth functions: a change in UN caused by the
replacement BN BN + f(N), where f(N) is an integer
function with rapidly decreasing Taylor-series coeffi-
cients, rapidly decreases with N. Thus, smooth errors
are immaterial even if they are large. In contrast, the
nonsmooth errors lead to a catastrophic effect, which
can be used for optimization: if the interpolation
procedure is not satisfactory, the behavior of UN at
large N cannot be interpreted in terms of a power-law
dependence [2]. Fig. 2.

To check this argumentation, a test experiment was
carried out for the 4 theory. The use of complete infor- tory.2 Clearly, the results obtained below should only

tive corrections to Eq. (14) vanish, are closest to the
exact value 1 [2].4

Figure 3a shows different estimates for the index

2 minima corresponding to ' and ''; (2) from the
position of the 2 minimum corresponding to b0 = ­/2;
(3) from a change in sign of U when processing by
taking the logarithm of UN (solid line in Fig. 2b); and
(4) the same but for processing with a fixed index
(dashed line in Fig. 2b). Figure 3b shows different esti-
mates obtained for : (1) from the U value at the 2
minima corresponding to ' and '' and (2) and (3) from

The discrepancy between different estimates gives a

measure of uncertainty of the results. For N

than unity. For N
~ > 0.25, there is a systematic increase
to 1.08, which is not controlled by the estimated error, but the 2
minima are ill-defined and unstable in this case. Similar behavior is
observed for . We take, as the most reliable, values in the

vative estimates for the accuracy including systematic
changes:

It follows from above that even this estimate of error is
not reliable.

It is easy to sum up the series for arbitrary g by cal-
culating the UN coefficients in Eq. (13) for N 30 and
continuing them according to the asymptotic expres-
sion found for U
