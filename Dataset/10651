Possibilities of a model independent treatment of the data from future real-time solar neutrino experiments (SNO,
Super-Kamiokande and others) are discussed. It is shown that in the general case of transitions of the initial solar
's into and/or the total flux of initial neutrinos and the survival probability can be determined directly






from the experimental data. Lower bounds for the probability of transition of solar 's into all possible sterile
states are derived and expressed through measurable quantities.

4. Conclusions

We have demonstrated that future solar neutrino ex-
periments in which neutrino will be detected through
the observation of different reactions have a great po-
tential for a model independent investigation of the
neutrino mixing problem. These experiments could
allow also to measure the flux of initial
's and to






test the SSM.
