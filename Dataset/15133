Abstract. We consider status of the Kr2Det project aimed at sensitive searches for neutrino oscillations
in the atmospheric neutrino mass parameter region around m2 ~ 3x10-3 eV2and at obtaining new
information on the electron neutrino mass structure (U ).

2.3. Data analysis and expected results

In no oscillation case the ratio of two
simultaneously measured positron energy
spectra SFAR/SNEAR is energy independent.
Small deviations from constant value of this
ratio

1.27m2 L F,N /E and L F,N are the distances
between the reactor and detectors) The results
of the analysis do not depend on the exact
knowledge of the neutrino flux and their
energy spectrum, burn up effects, the numbers
of target protons.... However possible relative
difference of the detector energy scales should
be strictly controlled. This can be done by a
combination of different methods briefly Fig.2. Reactor neutrino 90 % CL disappearance
