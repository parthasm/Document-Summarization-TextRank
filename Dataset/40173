<U><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1- Introduction</P>
</U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the last decade, a new field emerged on the borderline between nuclear and particle physics, that is the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. These new efforts have been investigated by estimates based on quantum chromodynamics QCD [1]. At very high energy densities, so-called quark gluon plasma QGP should exist. Such plasma consists of freely moving quarks, antiquarks and gluons which are no longer confined to nucleons as in normal matter. The main task of the problem is to understand the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic collisions with aiming at a quantitative description of the reaction. The most popular approach of investigating signals is to perform equilibrium calculations of hadronic and quark matters, and compare both with data. It is clear that any prediction for any of the signals depends strongly on the space-time evolution of the system. It is rather obvious that hadrons are destroyed during the reaction and we have to deal with quark-gluon rather than hadronic degrees of freedom. However, the quark-gluon system does not need to be equilibrated, so one might think of independent strings. The comparison of nucleus-nucleus (A-A) data with nucleon-nucleon (N-N) data may reflect light on the mechanism of interaction. However, in particular, this comparison is very sensitive, since at high energies, A-A collision is not simply a superposition of N-N collisions. The time scale between two N-N interactions is too small for hadronization, and therefore some intermediate object is involved in the second collision and all further ones. An alternative approach of studying high energy A-A scattering is to build models based on Gribove-Regg theory (GRT) [2]. There are many of quite elaborated models based on this theory, such as dual parton model [3] the quark gluon string [4] and the VENUS model [5]. The production of hadrons in the c.m. energies above several GeV is usually viewed as coloring string formation [6] and its decay or fragmentation. These approaches combine the kinematical constraints with assumptions above the mechanism and time evolution of the fragmentation process. In the present work we would like to extend our multi-string fragmentation hypothesis [7] in NN collision to the case of AA collisions. The best and reasonable way to do this, is to follow the cascade mechanism, and consider the problem in a microscopic point of view. The model in hand is based on the conjecture that the central rapidity region of production processes is dominated by the gluonic interactions whereas the jets of valance quarks populate the fragmentation regions containing the leading particles. The details of the model are presented in section 2. The Monte Carlo generators are described in section 3, and finally, result and discussion are given in section 4.</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2- <U>The Model</P>
</U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The model in hand deals with the nucleus-nucleus collisions as a superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. In other words, the nucleon-nucleon event is the basic unit to build up the generator. So that the model is fully microscopic so that each nucleon is individually followed on the time scale. The effect of the Fermi momentum [8] and the mean field [9] are considered. The collision is switched on at time t = 0, with appropriate beam velocity and impact parameter. Each nucleon in both the target and the projectile is given a label. Considering the z-axis as the collision axis, we divide the collision time into small time intervals and investigate all pairs of particles whether they scatter. The condition of scattering is that the two particles approach a distance less than <IMG SRC="Image1.gif" WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=28>, where <IMG SRC="Image2.gif" WIDTH=46 HEIGHT=24>is the total nucleon –nucleon cross section at square of center of mass energy s. The scattered particles then undergo either elastic or inelastic scattering. The inelastic interaction is based on the assumed dominance of hadronic collisions by gluonic interactions where the two colliding nucleons are represented by the valence quarks carrying their quantum numbers plus the accompanying clouds of gluons which represent also the sea quark pairs. In the course of collision, gluonic clouds interact strongly and form strings and sub-strings [10,11] according to their available energies. The elastic collisions are expected to occur only at relatively low energies, i.e., when the nucleon energies slow down below 2 GeV. The diffraction dissociation [12,13] is the main process in this case. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2-1 The mean field</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This type of field is very important, particularly when dealing problems of heavy ion collisions. The projectile nucleons, on passing through the target should feel a global field effect due to all the constituents of the target nucleus. This field is partially attractive and partially repulsive and depends on the nuclear density at the location of the particle under test. A reasonable parametric form of the mean field is:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Image3.gif" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=25>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(1)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where <FONT FACE="Symbol">s</FONT> &gt;1, A and B are the attractive and repulsive components of the field respectively. The change in momentum of the test particle due to this field is derived using the Heisenberg picture,</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2-3 The inelastic scattering</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inelastic term in this model is dealt through the string fragmentation hypothesis [7] and the interaction gluon model [14], whereas the fragmentation region containing (leading particles) are populated by the jets of valence quarks [15]. The main merits of this approach lie in the fact that the phenomenology is reduced to microscopic concepts like parton -parton cross sections and structure function and different equilibrium properties of the gluonic and quark components of hadrons. This phenomenology includes the formation stage rather than the hadronization. The string dynamics may be summarized in the string formation due to the color field existing between two interacting quarks. Consider a string formed by an original quark q<SUB>o</SUB> with energy <I>w<SUB>o</I></SUB>. At the first vertex of fragmentation, the string breaks up producing <IMG SRC="Image26.gif" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=20>with energy <I>z w</I><SUB>o</SUB> leaving the string with residual energy <IMG SRC="Image27.gif" WIDTH=93 HEIGHT=24>. Where <I>z</I> is a fraction 0&lt;<I>z</I>&lt;1 and has a distribution function <I>f </I>(<I>z</I>). Further fragmentation of the string will produce <IMG SRC="Image26.gif" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=20>pairs in rank order forming mesons.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here, n represents the number of nodes of the string. And since a meson is produced at each node, so <I>n</I> measures also the number of mesons produced in the string. This leads also to the well-known multiplicity logarithmic relation [7].</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let <I>D</I> (<I>z</I>) represents the probability to find a hadron in a quark jet carrying a fraction of energy z, then,</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3- <U>The Implementation of Monte Carlo</P>
</U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Monte Carlo technique means building up random number generator, or algorithm for each physical quantity in the system. The generated numbers are not completely random, since they are controlled with the boundary conditions rather than all the dynamic effects acting on the system. The building of the generators, usually starts with the pseudo random number series uniformly distributed in the range {0,1}, which are defined in most software related to mathematics such as FORTRAN 77- 90, MATHEMATICA and MATHCAD. The boundary of the range is then stretched according to the boundary conditions applied. Finally, the probability distribution of the generated numbers are directed toward preferable population region according to the nature of the applied fields and all other dynamic effects striking the system.

<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4- <U>Results and Discussion.</P>
</U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Monte Carlo program is applied to the reactions of p-<SUP>32</SUP>S a<SUP>32</SUP>S-<SUP>32</SUP>S at 200 A GeV. At least 200 runs are carried out simultaneously. A time interval <FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>t =0.5 <I>fm/c</I> and spatial scanned interval <FONT FACE="Symbol">d</FONT>x =0.5 <I>fm</I> are used. The mean field parameters are adjusted to setup the equilibrium condition of the nuclear density distribution during the collision time. It is found that the relative ratio of the strength of the attractive to the repulsive field is ~ 1.6 in p-<SUP>32</SUP>S and 2.7 in <SUP>32</SUP>S-<SUP>32</SUP>S collision, The power of the attractive component is c=1.2 in all cases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parameters of the elastic and the inelastic subroutines are determined so that the output prediction of the Monte Carlo fit the experimental rapidity and the transverse momentum distributions. The main process at this incident energy is the inelastic one. The elastic collision contributes only when the energy of the leading particles slowdown to few GeV, due to the successive collisions. The perturbed string fragmentation function Eq.(22) is used to estimate the relative production of the different types of hadrons. The multiplicity of a hadron <I>h</I> depends on the length of the string producing it. The parameter ‘<I>a’</I> in the fragmentation function <I>f</I>, plays an important role in controlling the length of the string and hence the production ratio of the hadron. The parameter ‘<I>a</I>’ is adjusted to fit the experimental data for each hadron type alone. The value of ‘a‘ is found in the range 0.8 &lt;a &lt;1.6 with average value 1.28.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The program starts while the incident projectile is about <I>15 fm</I> apart from the target center along the z-axis. In Fig.(1), the transverse momentum distribution of fast protons produced in p-<SUP>32</SUP>S collision at time intervals 8, 12, 16 and 20 <I>fm/c</I> are displayed. The earlier produced protons are spread over a wide momentum range. As time goes on, and because of multiple scattering, the particles are confined in narrower range. The final distribution corresponding to time t = 20 <I>fm/c</I>, shows a peak at <I>pt</I> = 0.3 GeV/c. The prediction of the model shows good agreement in Fig.(2) with the data of the experiment CERN-NA-035 [17]. The Monte Carlo simulates the nuclear matter density during the different stages of the reaction. The results are given in Fig.(3). At time t = 0, the initial density shows a large Gaussian peak centered at the origin representing the target nucleus and a tail in the negative region simulates the trace of the incident light proton. As time goes on, the mean field and the multiple scattering reflect their effect on the system. Hence, the nuclear matter density is disturbed and shifted forward. It reaches the equilibrium before t ~ <I>15 fm/c</I>. The <SUP>32</SUP>S - <SUP>32</SUP>S collisions predict different results due to the effect of the size of the projectile nucleus as well as the possible number of binary collisions. The nuclear density distribution is displayed in Fig.(4) for the <SUP>32</SUP>S - <SUP>32</SUP>S collision. At the starting time, t = 0 fm/c, the distribution shows two distinct peaks corresponding to the projectile and the target nuclei before collision. The projectile peak is the narrower since the Fermi momentum is omitted and the incident beam is forward collimated. The system takes a long time to reach its equilibrium (t = 20 fm/c). The transverse momentum distribution at different time intervals covers a wider range as seen by Fig.(5). At the end of the collision time the pt distribution shows a peak at 0.15 GeV/c. This agrees with the data of the experiment CERN-NA-035 as may be seen in Fig.(6).</P>
