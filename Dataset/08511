An algorithm is proposed for the determination of the asymptotics of a sum of a perturbation series from the
given values of its coefficients in the strong-coupling limit. When applied to the 4 theory, the algorithm yields
the (g) g behavior with 1 at large g for the Gell-Mann­Low function. © 2000 MAIK "Nauka/Interpe-

Many problems in theoretical physics require and arrived at the conclusion that the Gell-Mann­Low
advance in the strong-coupling region. The best known function in the 4 theory with the action functional
of them concern the dependence of the effective cou-
pling constant g on the distance scale L; the problems

renormalizable theories is determined by the equation behaves at large g as 0.9g2, which differs only in the
coefficient from the one-loop result 1.5g2 valid at g
­dg/d ln L = (g) (1) 0; similar behavior was obtained for (g) by Kubyshin
[5]. If this result is valid,1 then the 4 theory is self-con-
and generally requires information on the Gell-Mann­ tradictory. This conclusion seems to be strange from
