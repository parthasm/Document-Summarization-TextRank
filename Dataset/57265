The Gell-Mann­Low function in QCD (g) (g = g /162, where g is the coupling constant in the Lagrangian)
is shown to behave in the strong-coupling region as g, where ­13 and ~ 105.

is primarily attributed to the dependence at the lower
bound of averaging interval Nmin N Nmax. The upper
points in Fig. 2a correspond to small Nmin and to 2 ~
106 in the minima. As Nmin increases, decreases mono-
tonically until 2 reaches a value of ~103 (lower points).
With a further increase in Nmin, the pattern of 2 minima
becomes indistinct, and the uncertainty of the results
increases considerably. We admit some further
decrease in until the required values 2 ~ 10 are
reached, and take this into account in the course of error es-

timation. Uncertainty in parameter
is of several
order of magnitude (Fig. 2b), but the most probable
value is ~105, which is consistent with the basic array
of data. Thus, we have
