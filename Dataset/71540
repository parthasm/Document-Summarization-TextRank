Abstract--An algorithm is proposed for determining asymptotics of the sum of a perturbative series in the
strong coupling limit using given values of the expansion coefficients. Application of the algorithm is illus-
trated, methods for estimating errors are developed, and an optimization procedure is described. Applied to the
4 theory, the algorithm yields the Gell-Mann­Low function asymptotics of the type (g) 7.4g0.96 for large g.
The fact that the exponent is close to unity can be interpreted as a manifestation of the logarithmic branching
of the type (g) ~ g(lng)­ (with 0.14), which is confirmed by independent evidence. In any case, the 4
theory is self-consistent. The procedure of summing perturbative series with arbitrary values of the expansion
parameter is discussed.

According to the standard procedure of calculating log2
the critical indices [6], the second series (9) is truncated
on the Lth term that corresponds to the error given by b0 = 5
15
(72) with Nc = L + 1 and as ~ 1. In the three-dimen- 3
sional case, a large number of expansion coefficients 2
are known (for L = 6). These values are well matched
with (2), which gives hope for restoring the asymptotics 1

for increasing Nc at the expense of interpolation. Thus, ­1
it is apparently possible to increase the accuracy of cal-
culation of the critical indices by two­three orders of 5
magnitude even for the currently available information.
Using the modified conformal mapping may lead to a
further increase in the accuracy, provided that the scale ­2 0 2 4 6 8
