The Masses of elementary particles and hadrons

Ding-Yu Chung


The masses of elementary particles and hadrons can be calculated from
the periodic table of elementary particles. The periodic table is derived from
dimensional hierarchy for the seven extra spatial dimensions. As a molecule is the
composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the composite of elementary
particles with hadronic bonds. The masses of elementary particles and hadrons
can be calculated using the periodic table with only four known constants: the
number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring, the mass of electron, the
mass of Z°, and e. The calculated masses are in good agreement with the
observed values. For examples, the calculated masses for the top quark, neutron,
and pion are 176.5 GeV, 939.54MeV, and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with
the observed masses, 176 ± 13 GeV, 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively.
The masses of 110 hadrons are calculated. The overall average difference
between the calculated masses and the observed masses for all hadrons is 0.29
MeV. The periodic table of elementary particles provides the most comprehensive
explanation and calculation for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.

1. Introduction

The mass hierarchy of elementary particles is one of the most difficult
problems in particle physics. There are various approaches to solve the problem.
In this paper, the approach is to use a periodic table. The properties of atoms can
be expressed by the periodic relationships in the periodic table of the elements.
The periodic table of the elements is based on the atomic orbital structure. Do
elementary particles possess orbital structure? In this paper, the orbital structure
for elementary particles is constructed from the superstring. The extra dimensions
in the superstring become the orbits with dimensional hierarchy. The energy is
assumed to be distributed differently in different dimensions in such way that the
energy increases with increased number of spacetime dimensions.
All elementary particles are placed in the periodic table of elementary
particles [1]. As a molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a
hadron is the composite of elementary particles with hadronic bonds. The masses
of elementary particles and hadrons can be calculated using only four known
constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring, the mass
of electron, the mass of Z°, and e. The calculated masses of elementary particles
and hadrons are in good agreement with the observed values. For examples, the
calculated masses for the top quark, neutron, and pion are 176.5 GeV,
939.54MeV, and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses,
176 ± 13 GeV [2], 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively.

2. Dimensional
hierarchy

A supermembrane can be described as two dimensional object that moves
in an eleven dimensional space-time [3]. This supermembrane can be converted
into the ten dimensional superstring with the extra dimension curled into a circle to
become a closed superstring. Based on this eleven-dimensional
supermembrane, the seven extra space dimension assumes dimensional
hierarchy.
Each extra space-time dimension can be described by a fermion and a
boson. The masses of fermion and its boson partner are not the same. This
supersymmetry breaking is in the form of a energy hierarchy with increasing
energies from the dimension five to the dimension eleven as

F5 B5 F6 B6 F7 B7 F8 B8 F9 B9 F10 B10 F11 B11

where B and F are boson and fermion in each spacetime dimension. The
probability to transforming a fermion into its boson partner in the adjacent
dimension is same as the fine structure constant, , the probability of a fermion
emitting or absorbing a boson. The probability to transforming a boson into its
fermion partner in the same dimension is also the fine structure constant, . This
hierarchy can be expressed in term of the dimension number, D,

2


E D-1, B = E D,F D,F , (1)
E D, F = E D, B D, B , (2)

where ED,B and ED,F are the energies for a boson and a fermion, respectively, and
D, B or D,F is the fine structure constant, which is the ratio between the energies
of a boson and its fermionic partner. All fermions and bosons are related by the
order 1/. (In some mechanism for the dynamical supersymmetry breaking, the
effects of order exp(-42/ g2 ) where g is some small coupling, give rise to large
mass hierarchies [4].) Assuming D,B = D,F , the relation between the bosons in
the adjacent dimensions, then, can be expressed in term of the dimension
number, D,

E D-1, B = E D, B 2 D , (3)
or
E
E D , B
= - 1 , (4)
D , B 2
D

where D= 6 to 11, and E5,B and E11,B are the energies for the dimension five and
the dimension eleven, respectively.
The lowest energy is the Coulombic field, E5,B

E 5, B =
M6,F
= Me, (5)

where Me is the rest energy of electron, and = e , the fine structure constant for
the magnetic field. The bosons generated are called "dimensional bosons" or
"B 0
D". Using only e, the mass of electron, the mass of Z , and the number of extra
dimensions (seven), the masses of BD as the gauge boson can be calculated as
shown in Table 1.

B 0

In Table 1, w is not same as of the rest, because there is symmetry
group mixing between B5 and B7 as the symmetry mixing in the standard theory of
the electroweak interaction, and sinw is not equal to 1. As shown latter, B5, B6, B7,
B 0 0
8, B9, and B10 are A (massless photon), 1/2, ZL , XR, XL, and ZR , respectively,
responsible for the electromagnetic field, the strong interaction, the weak (left
handed) interaction, the CP (right handed) nonconservation, the CP (left handed)
nonconservation, and the P (right handed) nonconservation, respectively. The
calculated value for w is 29.690 in good agreement with 28.70 for the observed
value of w [5]. The total energy of the eleven dimensional superstring is the sum
of all energies of both fermions and bosons. The calculated total energy is
1.1x1019 GeV in good agreement with the Planck mass, 1.2x1019 GeV, as the total
energy of the superstring. As shown later, the calculated masses of all gauge
bosons are also in good agreement with the observed values. Most importantly,
the calculation shows that exactly seven extra dimensions are needed for all
fundamental interactions.
In dimensional hierarchy, the bosons and the fermions in the dimensions >
5 gain masses in the four dimensional spacetime by combining with scalar Higgs
bosons in the four dimensional spacetime. Without combining with scalar Higgs
bosons, neutrino and photon remain massless. Graviton, the massless boson
from the vibration of the superstring, remains massless.

3. The Internal Symmetries And The Interactions

All six non-gravitational dimensional bosons are represented by the internal
symmetry groups, consisting of two sets of symmetry groups, U(1), U(1), and
SU(2) with the left-right symmetry. Each BD is represented by an internal
symmetry group as follows.

B5: U(1), B6: U(1), B7: SU(2)L, B8: U(1)R, B9: U(1)L, B10: SU(2)R

The additional symmetry group, U(1) X SU(2)L, is formed by the "mixing" of U(1) in
B5 and SU(2)L in B7. This mixing is same as in the standard theory of the
electroweak interaction.
As in the standard theory to the electroweak interaction, the boson mixing of
U(1) and SU(2)L is to create electric charge and to generate the bosons for leptons
and quarks by combining isospin and hypercharge. The hypercharges for both e+
and are 1, while for both u and d quarks, they are 1/3 [6]. The electric charges
for e+ and are 1 and 0, respectively, while for u and d quarks, they are 2/3 and -
1/3, respectively.
There is no strong interaction from the internal symmetry for the
dimensional bosons, originally. The strong interaction is generated by
"leptonization" [7], which means quarks have to behave like leptons. Leptons have
integer electric charges and hypercharges, while quarks have fractional electric
charges and hypercharges. The leptonization is to make quarks behave like

4


leptons in terms of "apparent" integer electric charges and hypercharges.
Obviously, the result of such a leptonization is to create the strong interaction,
which binds quarks together in order to make quarks to have the same "apparent"
integer electric charges and hypercharges as leptons. There are two parts for this
strong interaction: the first part is for the charge, and the second part is for the
hypercharge. The first part of the strong interaction allows the combination of a
quark and an antiquark in a particle, so there is no fractional electric charge. It
involves the conversion of 1/2 boson in B6 into the electrically chargeless meson
field by combining two 1/2, analogous to the combination of e+ and e- fields, so the
meson field becomes chargeless. (The mass of , 135 MeV, is twice of the mass
of a half-pion boson, 70 MeV, minus the binding energy. 1/2 becomes
pseudoscalar up or down quark in pion.) In the meson field, no fractional charge
of quark can appear. The second part of the strong interaction is to combine three
quarks in a particle, so there is no fractional hypercharge. It involves the
conversion of B5 (1/2) into the gluon field with three colors. The number of colors
(three) in the gluon field is equal to the ratio between the lepton hypercharge and
quark hypercharge. There are three 1/2 in the gluon field, and at any time, only
one of the three colors appears in a quark. Quarks appear only when there is a
combination of all three colors or color-anticolor. In the gluon field, no fractional
hypercharge of quarks can appear. By combining both of the meson field and the
gluon field, the strong interaction is the three-color gluon field based on the
chargeless vector meson field from the combination of two 1/2's. The total number
of 1/2 is 6, so the fine structure constant, s, for the strong force is

= 6 e1
S
(6)
= 0119
.

which is in a good agreement with the observed value, 0.124 [8].
The dimensional boson, B8, is a CP violating boson, because B8 is
assumed to have the CP-violating U(1)R symmetry. The ratio of the force constants
between the CP-invariant WL in B8 and the CP-violating XR in B8 is

2 2
G
8 E7 cos W

G W
E8
-10
= 5.3 X 10 ,

which is in the same order as the ratio of the force constants between the CP-
invariant weak interaction and the CP-violating interaction with S = 2.
The dimensional boson, B9 (XL), has the CP-violating U(1)L symmetry. The
lepton (l9) and the quark (q9) are outside of the three families for leptons and
quarks, so baryons in dimension nine do not have to have the baryon number
conservation. The baryon which does not conserve baryon number has the
baryon number of zero. The combination of the CP-nonconservation and the
5


baryon number of zero leads to the baryon, p -
9 , with the baryon number of zero
and the baryon, p -
9 + , with the baryon number of 1. The decay of p9 is as
follows.

p - °
9 - l9 l9

The combination this p + ° °
9 - and p9 as well as leptons, l9 l9 results in

p ° ° - ° ° °
9 + p9 - + l9 l9 p9 + + l9 l9 + l9 l9
p - °
9 + + l9 + radiation + l9
n9 ° + radiation

Consequently, excess baryons, n9 °, are generated in the dimension nine. These
excess baryons, n9 ° , become the predecessors of excess neutrons in the low
energy level.
The ratio of force constants between XR with CP-independent baryon
number and XL with CP-dependent baryon number is

which is in the same order as the observed ratio of the numbers between the left
handed baryons (proton or neutron) and photons in the universe.

4. The periodic table of elementary particles

Leptons and quarks are complementary to each other, expressing different
aspects of superstring. The model for leptons and quarks is shown in Fig. 1. The
periodic table for elementary particles is shown in Table 2.

D is the dimensional orbital number for the seven extra space dimensions.
The auxiliary dimensional orbital number, a, is for the seven extra auxiliary space
dimensions. All gauge bosons, leptons, and quarks are located on the seven
dimensional orbits and seven auxiliary orbits. Most leptons are dimensional
fermions, while all quarks are the sums of subquarks from the loops around the tori
from the compacified extra dimensions. e, e, µ , and are dimensional
fermions for dimension 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively. All neutrinos have zero mass
because of chiral symmetry.
The dimensional fermions for D = 5 and 6 are neutrino (l5) and electron (l6).
Other fermions are generated, so there are more than one fermion in the same
dimension. These extra fermions include quarks and heavy leptons (µ and ). To
generate a quark whose mass is higher than the lepton in the same dimension is
to add the lepton to the boson from the combined lepton-antilepton, so the mass of


7


the quark is three times of the mass of the corresponding lepton in the same
dimension. The equation for the quark mass is

M = 3M (9)
q l
D D



The mixing between the fifth and the seventh dimensional orbits which is
same as the symmetry mixing in the standard model allows the seventh
dimensional orbit to be the starting dimensional orbit for the additional orbits,
auxiliary orbits with quantum number "a." (The total number of the auxiliary orbits
is also seven as the seven dimensional orbits.)
A heavy lepton (µ or ) is the combination of the dimensional leptons and
the auxiliary dimensional leptons. In the same way, a heavy quark is the
combination of the dimensional quarks from Eq.(9) and the auxiliary quarks. The
mass of the auxiliary dimensional fermion (AF for both heavy lepton and heavy
quark) is generated from the corresponding dimensional boson as follows.

M a
M BD 1,
= - 0 a4 ,
(10)

where a = auxiliary dimensional fine structure constant, and a = auxiliary
M
dimension number = 0 or integer. The first term, BD-1,0 , of the mass formula
a
(Eq.(10)) for the auxiliary dimensional fermions is derived from the mass equation,
a
Eq. (1), for the dimensional fermions and bosons. The second term, a4
, of the
a=0
mass formula is for Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization for a charge - dipole interaction
in a circular orbit as described by A. Barut [9]. 1/a is 3/2. The coefficient, 3/2, is
to convert the dimensional boson mass to the mass of the auxiliary dimensional
fermion in the higher dimension by adding the boson mass to its fermion mass
which is one-half of the boson mass. The formula for the mass of auxiliary
dimensional fermions (AF) becomes

When the mass of this auxiliary dimensional fermion is added to the sum of
masses from the corresponding dimensional fermions (zero auxiliary dimension

formula for heavy leptons and quarks is derived as follows.

Each fermion can be defined by dimensional numbers (D's) and auxiliary
dimensional numbers (a's). Heavy leptons and quarks consist of one or more D's and a's.
The compositions and calculated masses of leptons and quarks are listed in Table 3.

The lepton for dimension five is e, and the quark for the same dimension is
u5, whose mass is equal to 3 Me from Eq. (9). The lepton for the dimension six is
e, and the quark for this dimension is d6. u5 and d6 represent the "light quarks" or
"current quarks" which have low masses. The dimensional lepton for the
dimensions seven is µ. All 's become massless by the chiral symmetry to
preserve chirality. The auxiliary dimensional leptons (Al) in the dimension seven
are µ7 and 7 whose masses can be calculated by Eq. (13) derived from Eq. (11).

where a = 1, 2 for µ7 and 7, respectively. The mass of µ is the sum of e and µ7,
and the mass of is the sum of e + 7, as in Eq.(12).

dimension seven) is 3µ instead of massless 3 as in Eq. (9). According to the

quarks, Aq7,a , is as follows.


where 7 = w , and a = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for u7/d7, s7, c7, b7, and t7, respectively.
The dimensional lepton for the dimension eight is , whose mass is zero to
preserve chirality. The heavy lepton for the dimensional eight is µ` as the sum of e,
µ, and µ8 (auxiliary dimensional lepton). Because there are only three families for
leptons, µ' is the extra lepton, which is "hidden". µ' can appear only as µ + photon.
The pairing of µ + µ from the hidden µ' and regular µ may account for the
occurrence of same sign dilepton in the high energy level [10]. For the dimension
eight, q8 (the F8 for quarks) is µ' instead of 3µ', because the hiding of µ' allows q8 to
be µ'. The hiding of µ' for leptons is balanced by the hiding of b8 for quarks.
The calculated masses are in good agreement with the observed
constituent masses of leptons and quarks [2,11]. The mass of the top quark found
by Collider Detector Facility is 176 ± 13 GeV [2] in a good agreement with the
calculated value, 176.5 GeV.

5. Hadrons

As molecules are the composites of atoms, hadrons are the composites of
elementary particles. Hadron can be represented by elementary particles in many
different ways. One way to represent hadron is through the nonrelativistic
constituent quark model where the mass of a hadron is the sum of the masses of
quarks plus a relatively small binding energy. 1/2 (u or d pseudoscalar quark), u,
d, s, c, b, and t quarks mentioned above are nonrelativistic constituent quarks. On
10


the other hand, except proton and neutron, all hadrons are unstable, and decay
eventually into low-mass quarks and leptons. Is a hadron represented by all
nonrelativistic quarks or by low-mass quarks and leptons? This paper proposes a
dual formula: the full quark formula for all nonrelativistic constituent quarks (1/2, u,
d, s, c, and b) and the basic fermion formula for the lowest- mass quark (1/2 and
u) and lepton (e). The calculation of the masses of hadrons requires both
formulas. The full quark formula sets the initial mass for a hadron. This initial
mass is matched by the mass resulted from the combination of various particles
in the basic fermion formula. The mass of a hadron is the mass plus the binding
energy in the basic fermion formula.

M full quark formula M basic fermion formula
M hadron = M basic fermion formula + binding energy (15)
This dual representation of hadrons by the full quark formula and the basic quark
formula is seen in the treatment of nucleons [12] as a mixture of the quark model
and the vector meson dominance model which can be represented by 1/2 and u.
The full quark formula consists of the vector quarks (u, d, s, c, and b) and
pseudoscalar quark, 1/2 (70.03 MeV), which is B6 (dimension boson in the
dimension six). The strong interaction converts B6 (1/2) into pseudoscalar u and
d quark in pseudoscalar meson. The combination of the pseudoscalar quark
(1/2) and vector quarks (q) results in hybrid quarks (q' ) whose mass is the
average mass of pseudoscalar quark and vector quark.

Mq' = 1/2 ( Mq + M1/2) (16)

Hybrid quarks include u', d', and s' whose masses are 200.398, 201.164, and
314.148 MeV, respectively. For baryons other than n and p, the full quark
formula is the combination of vector quarks, hybrid quarks (u' and d'), and
pseudoscalar quark (1/2). For example, ° (uds) is u'd's3, where 3 denotes 3
1/2. For pseudoscalar mesons (J = 0), the full quark formula is the combination
of 1/2 and q' (u', d' and s') or 1/2 alone. For vector mesons (J > 0), the full
quark formula is the combination of vector quarks (u, d, s, c, and b) and 1/2 .
For examples, ° is 2, (1295,J =0) is u'u'd'd'8, and K1 (1400, J=1) is ds8. The
compositions of hadrons from the particles of the full quark formula are listed in
Table 4.

Different energy states in hadron spectroscopy are the results of
differences in the numbers of 1/2. The higher the energy state, the higher the
number of 1/2. The number of 1/2 attached to q or q' in the full quark formula is
restricted. The number of 1/2 can be 0, ±1, ±3, ±4, ±7, and ±3n (n>2). This is
the "1/2 series." The number, 3, is indicative of a baryon-like (3 quarks in a
baryon) number. The number, 4, is the combination of 1 and 3, while the
number, 7, is the combination of 3 and 4. Since 1/2 is essentially pseudoscalar
u and d quarks, the 1/2 series is closely related to u and d quarks. Since s is
close to u and d, the 1/2 series is also related to s quark. . Each presence of u,
d, and s associates with one single 1/2 series. The single 1/2 series associates
with baryons and the mesons with uu dd ss, ss, dc, uc, db, ub, sc, and
sb. The combination of two single 1/2 series is the double 1/2 series (0, ±2, ±6,
±8, ±14, and ±6n) associating with ud and ds mesons. For the mesons (cc
and bb) without u, d, or s, the numbers of 1/2 attached to quarks can be from
the single 1/2 series or the double 1/2 series.
The basic fermion formula is similar to M. H. MacGregor's light quark
model [13], whose calculated masses and the predicted properties of hadrons
are in very good agreement with observations. In the light quark model, the
mass building blocks are the "spinor" (S with mass 330.4 MeV) and the mass
quantum (mass = 70MeV). S has 1/2 spin and neutral charge, while the basic
quantum has zero spin and neutral charge. For the basic fermion formula, S is
u, the quark with the lowest mass (330.77 MeV), and the basic quantum is 1/2
(mass = 70.025 MeV). In the basic fermion formula, u and 1/2 have the same
spins and charge as S and the basic quantum, respectively. For examples, in
the basic fermion formula, neutron is SSS, and K1 (1400, J=1) is S2 11, where S2
denotes two S, and 11 denotes 11 1/2 's.
In additional to S and 1/2, the basic fermion formula includes P (positive
charge) and N (neutral charge) with the masses of proton and neutron. As in

12


the light quark model, the mass associated with positive or negative charge is the
electromagnetic mass, 4.599 MeV, which is nine times the mass of electron.
This mass (nine times the mass of electron) is derived from the baryon-like
electron that represents three quarks in a baryon and three electron in d6 quark
as in Table 2. This electromagnetic mass is observed in the mass difference
between ° (2) and + (2+) where + denotes positive charge. The calculated
mass different is one electromagnetic mass, 4.599 MeV, in good agreement with
the observed mass difference, 4.594 MeV, between ° and +. (The values for
observed masses are taken from "Particle Physics Summary "[14].) The
particles in the basic fermion formula are listed in Table 5.

Hadrons are the composites of quarks as molecules composing of atoms.
As atoms are bounded together by chemical bonds, hadrons are bounded by
"hadronic bonds," connecting the particles in the basic fermion formula. These
hadronic bonds are similar to the hadronic bonds in the light quark model.
The hadronic bonds are the overlappings of the auxiliary dimensional
orbits. As in Eq (11), the energy derived from the auxiliary orbit for S (u quark) is

Ea = (3/2) (3 Mµ) w
= 14.122 MeV (17)

The auxiliary orbit is a charge - dipole interaction in a circular orbit as described by
A. Barut [9], so a fermion for the circular orbit and an electron for the charge are
embedded in this hadronic bond. The fermion for the circular orbit is the
supersymmetrical fermion for the auxiliary dimensional orbit according to Eq (2).

The binding energy (negative energy) for the bond (S!S) between two S's is
twice of 14.122 MeV minus the masses of the supersymmetrical fermion and
electron.
E S -S = - 2 (Ea - Mf - Me)
= -26.384 MeV (19)

It is similar to the binding energy (-26 MeV) in the light quark model. An example
of S!S bond is in neutron (S - S - S) which has two S - S bonds. The mass of
neutron can be calculated as follows.

13


Mn = 3MS + 2ES-S
= 939.54 MeV, (20)

which is in excellent agreement with the observed mass, 939.57 MeV. The mass
of proton is the mass of neutron minus the mass difference (three times of
electron mass = M3e) between u and d quark as shown in Table 2. Proton is
represented as S - S - (S -3e). The calculation of the mass of proton is as
follows.

Ea for (S-3e) = (3/2) (3 (Mµ - M3e)) w
M f =
Ea w
Mp = 2 MS + M(S-3e) + ES!S + ES!(S-3e)
= 938.21 MeV (21)

The calculated mass is in a good agreement with the observed mass, 938.27
MeV.
The binding energy for 1/2 - 1/2 bond can be derived in the same way as
Eqs (17), (18), and (19).

Ea = (3/2) M1/2 w
M f = Ea w
E 1/2 - 1/2 = - 2 (Ea - Mf - Me)
= -5.0387 MeV (22)

It is similar to the binding energy (-5 MeV) in the light quark model. An example
for the binding energy of 1/2 - 1/2 bond is in °. The mass of ° can be
calculated as follows.

M° = 2 M1/2 + E 1/2 - 1/2
= 135.01 MeV. (23)

The calculated mass of ° is in excellent agreement with the observed value,
134.98 MeV. There is one 1/2 - 1/2 bond per pair of 1/2 `s, so there are two 1/2
- 1/2 bonds for 4 1/2 `s, and three 1/2 - 1/2 bonds for 6 1/2 `s.
Another bond is N - 1/2 or P - 1/2, the bond between neutron or proton
and 1/2. Since N is SSS, N - 1/2 bond is derived from S - 1/2. The binding
energy of S - 1/2 is the average between S-S and 1/2 - 1/2.

E S - 1/2 = 1/2 ( ES-S + E 1/2 - 1/2) (24)
An additional dipole (e +e -) is needed to connected S - 1/2 to neutron.

E N - 1/2 =
E
S - 1/2 + 2 Me
= - 14.689 MeV. (25)
14


It is similar to -15 MeV in the light quark model. An example for P - 1/2 is +
which is represented by P4 whose structure is 2 - P - 2. The 4 1/2 's are
connected to P with two P - 1/2 bonds. The mass of + is as follows.

M +
=
MP + 4 M1/2 + 2 E N - 1/2
= 1189.0 MeV. (26)

The calculated mass is in a good agreement with the observed mass, 1189.4 ±
0.07 MeV.
There is N ­ N hadronic bond between two N's. N has the structure of S ­
S ­ S. N ­ N has a hexagonal structure shown in Fig. 2.
S

Fig. 2. The structure of N - N

There are two additional S ­ S for each N. The total number of S ­ S bonds
between two N's is 4. An example is °c (ssc) which has the basic fermion
formula of N 2 S9 with the structure of 3 ­ N ­ N ­ 6 S. The mass of °c can be
calculated as follows.

M = 2MN + MS + 9M1/2 + 4 ES ­ S + 2 E N - 1/2
= 2705.3 MeV (27)

The calculated mass for °c is in a good agreement with the observed mass
(2704 ± 4 MeV). For baryons other than p and n, there are two or three N - 1/2
or P - 1/2 bonds per baryon. It is used to distinguish J = ½ and J 3/2. For J =
½ which have asymmetrical spins (two up and one down), there are two bonds
for three S in a baryon to represent the asymmetrical spins. For J 3/2, there are
three bonds for three S in a baryon except if there is only one 1/2, only two
bonds exists for a baryon.
Among the particles in the basic fermion formula, there are hadronic
bonds, but not all particles have hadronic bonds. In the basic fermion formula,
hadronic bonds appear only among the particles that relate to the particles in the
corresponding full quark formula. The related particles are the "core" particles
that have hadronic bonds, and the unrelated particles are "filler" particles that
have no hadronic bonds. In the basic fermion formula, for baryons other than p
and n, the core particles are P, N, and 1/2. For the mesons consisting of u and d
quarks, the core particles are 1/2, S, and N. For the mesons containing one u,
15


d, or s along with s, c, or b, the core particles are S and N, and no hadronic
bond exist among 1/2's , which are the filler particles. For the mesons (cc and
bb), the only hadronic bond is N - N. The occurrences of hadronic bonds are
listed in Table 6.

An example is the difference between and f0. The decay modes of f0
include the mesons of s quarks from K meson. Consequently, there is no 1/2 -
1/2 for f0. The basic fermion formula for f0 is 14. The mass of f0 is as follows.

M = 14M1/2
= 980.4 MeV (28)

The observed mass is 980 ± 10 MeV.
In additional to the binding energies for hadronic bonds, hadrons have
Coulomb energy (-1.2 MeV) between positive and negative charges and
magnetic binding energy (±2MeV per interaction) for S - S from the light quark
model [13]. In the light quark model, the dipole moment of a hadron can be
calculated from the magnetic binding energy. Since in the basic fermion formula,
magnetic binding energy becomes a part of hadronic binding energy as shown in
Eq (19), magnetic binding energy for other baryons is the difference in magnetic
binding energy between a baryon and n or p. If a baryon has a similar dipole
moment as p or n, there is no magnetic binding energy for the baryon. An
example for Coulomb energy and magnetic binding energy is (uds, J=1/2)
whose formula is P3- with the structure of 2 - P - 1- where "-" denotes negative
charge. The dipole moment of is ­6.13 µN, while the dipole moment of proton
(P) is 2.79 µN [13]. According to the light quark model, this difference in dipole
moment represents -6 MeV magnetic binding energy. The Coulomb energy
between the positive charge P and the negative charge 1- is ­1.2 MeV. The
electromagnetic mass for 1- is 4.599 MeV. The mass of is calculated as
follows.
16


M =
MP + 3M1/2 + Me.m. + 2 E N - 1/2 + Emag + Ecoul
= 1116.4 MeV (29)

The observed mass is 1115.7 ± 0.0006 MeV.
An example of the dual representation of the full quark formula and the
basic fermion formula as expressed by Eq. (15) is (uds). The full quark
formula for is u'd's'3 with mass of 1169.9 MeV. This mass is matched by the
mass of the basic fermion formula, P3- with the mass of 1152.9 MeV. The final
mass of is 1152.9 MeV plus the various binding energies.
Table 7 is the results of calculation for the masses of baryons selected
from Ref. (18). The hadrons selected are the hadrons with precise observed
masses and known quantum states such as isospin and spin.

The full quark formula for baryons other than p and n involves hybrid
quarks (u' and d'), vector quarks (s, c, and b), and pseudoscalar quark (1/2 ).
The whole spectrum of baryons (other than p and n) follows the single 1/2 series

18


with 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 3n. 1/2 is closely related to u and d, so the lowest energy
state baryons (and ) that contain low mass quark and high number of u or d
have high number of 1/2. . On the contrary, the lowest energy state baryons (,
c, and b) that contain high mass quarks and no or low number of u and d have
low number of 1/2 or no 1/2. 1/2 's are added to the lowest energy state baryons
to form the high-energy state baryons.
The basic fermion formula includes P, N, S, and 1/2. If the dominant
decay mode includes p, the basic fermion formula includes P. If the dominant
decay mode includes n, the basic fermion formula includes N. If the decay
mode does not include either n or p directly, the baryon with the dipole moment
similar to p or n has the basic fermion formula with P or N, respectively. If the
dipole moment is not known, the designation of P or N for the higher energy
state baryon follows the designation of P or N for the corresponding lower energy
state baryon. Only N is used in the multiple nucleons such as N2 (two N's).
The result of calculated masses for light unflavored mesons is listed in

numbers.

The full quark formulas for light unflavored mesons are different for
different decay modes. There are three different types of the full quark formula
for light unflavored mesons. Firstly, when the decay mode is all leptons or all
mesons with u and d quarks, the full quark formula consists of 1/2, u', d', u, and d
quarks, Secondly, when u, d, and leptons are in the major decay modes, and s
is in the minor decay modes, the full quark formula consists of 1/2, u', d', s', u, d,
and s quarks. The most common full quark formula for such mesons is uds,
which is essentially ½ (uu dd ss). Finally, when s quarks are in the major or
all decay mode, the full quark formula consists of 1/2 `s and s quarks. When J =
0, the full quark formula includes 1/2 `s and hybrid quarks (u', d', and s'). When J
> 0, the full quark formula includes 1/2 `s and vector quarks (u, d, and s). Since
there are double presence of u and d quarks for the full quark formula with u and
d quark, it follows the double 1/2 series: 0, 2, 6, 8, 14, and 6n. The full quark
formula with odd presence of u, d, and s follows the single 1/2 series: 0, ±1, ±3,
±4, ±7, and ±3n.
The basic fermion formula includes 1/2 `s, S, and N. 1/2 - 1/2 hadronic
bond exists in the full quark formula with u and d quarks, and does not exist in
the full quark formula with s quark. S - S bond exists in all formula. Light
unflavored mesons decay into symmetrical low mass mesons, such as 2, 3o,
and 02 from , or asymmetrical high and low mass mesons, such as
asymmetrical +, 0, and 00 from ' . To distinguish the asymmetrical
decay modes from the symmetrical decay modes, one "counter 1/2 - 1/2
hadronic bond" is introduced in ' [13]. The binding energy for the counter 1/2 -
1/2 hadronic bond is 5.04 MeV, directly opposite to ­5.04 MeV for the 1/2 - 1/2
hadronic bond. All light unflavored mesons with asymmetrical decay modes
include this counter 1/2 - 1/2 hadronic bonds. For an example, the mass of '
(14+-) is calculated as follows.

M' = 14 M1/2 + 2 Me.m. + Ee.m. + 7E1/2 - 1/2 - E1/2 - 1/2
= 958.2 MeV (30)

The observed mass is 957.8 ± 0.14 MeV.
The result of the mass calculation for the mesons consisting of u, d, or s
with s, c, or b is listed in Table 9.

The full quark formula for these mesons contains 1/2's, u', d', s', u, d, s, c,
and b. The full quark formula for the mesons with J = 0 contains 1/2, hybrid
quarks (u', d', and s'), c, and b quarks. The full quark formula with J > 0 contains
1/2's and vector quarks (u, d, s, c, and b). Strange mesons have double
presence of d and s, so it follows the double 1/2 series. All other mesons have
22


single presence of u, d, or s, so they follow the single 1/2 series. The basic
fermion formula consists of 1/2's, S, and N. There is no 1/2 - 1/2 bond. There
are S - S and N - N bonds. For example, the mass of Bs (N5 S3) is calculated as
follows.
M = 5MN + 3MS + (10+ 2) MS-S
= 5373.5 MeV (31)
There are 10 S - S bonds for N5 (two S - S bonds for each N) and 2 S - S
bonds for S3. The observed mass is 5369.3 ± 2 MeV.

The full quark formula contains c or b. Since it contains no u, d, or s related
to 1/2, it follows a mixed 1/2 series from both the single 1/2 series and the double
23


1/2 series. Since c and b are high mass quarks unlike the low mass u and d
quarks that relate to 1/2, the 1/2 series actually starts from a negative 1/2. The
basic fermion formula contains 1/2's, S, and N. The only hadronic bond is N - N.
An example is J/ (N2 S4) whose mass (3096.9 ± 0.04 MeV) is calculated as
follows.

M = 2 MN + 4 MS + 4 MS-S
= 3096.7 MeV (32)

6. Conclusion

The periodic table of elementary particles (Fig. 1 and Table 2) is
constructed from dimensional hierarchy. All leptons, quarks, and gauge bosons
can be placed in the periodic table. The masses of elementary particles can be
calculated using only four known constants: the number of the extra spatial
dimensions in the eleven dimensional membrane, the mass of electron, the mass
of Z°, and e. The calculated masses (Tables 1 and 3) of elementary particles
derived from the periodic table are in good agreement with the observed values.
For an example, the calculated mass (176.5 GeV) of the top quark has an
excellent agreement with the observed mass (176 ± 13 GeV).
A hadron can be represented by the full quark formula (Table 4) and the
basic quark formula (Table 5). The full quark formula consists of all quarks,
pseudoscalar quark in pion, and the hybrid quarks. The basic quark formula
consists of the lowest mass quarks. The relation between these two formulas is
expressed by Eq. (15). As a molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical
bonds, a hadron is the composite of elementary particles with "hadronic bonds"
(Table 6) which are the overlappings of the auxiliary dimensional orbits. The
calculated masses (Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10) of hadrons are in good agreement with
the observed values. For examples, the calculated masses for neutron and pion
are 939.54 and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses,
939.57 and 134.98 MeV, respectively. The overall average difference between the
calculated masses and the observed masses for all hadrons (110 hadrons) is 0.29
MeV, and the standard deviation for such differences is 5.06 MeV. The average
observed error for the masses of the hadrons is ± 6.41 MeV. The periodic table of
elementary particles provides the most comprehensive explanation and calculation
for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.
