Abstract


It is pointed out that Higgs bootstrap is inherent in the top-
condensate models of Nambu and Bardeen et al in that the
ladder sum of Higgs pole diagrams in one channel reproduces
a Higgs pole in the crossed-channel. This result is exact
whenever color flows simultaneously in both channel
directions e.g. for N 1 . Bootstrap solutions for the Higgs
c

boson mass are obtained that are compatible with the
condensate models such as the top-color models which imply
large top-Yukawa couplings at the top mass.

I. Introduction


The suggestion [1], [2], [3] that the top-quark can couple to the Higgs


boson more strongly than in the standard model leads to many interesting


questions. One of these is the role the Higgs boson will play by providing a


strong (attractive) force through t-channel exchange that can create bound


states in J P ¡ O¢ channel (s-channel) of the top-antitop (tt ) scattering


amplitude. A natural question to ask then is whether the Higgs boson will


itself be among these bound states; that is, whether the dynamics will permit


the Higgs boson to bootstrap itself.


Interestingly under certain circumstances a Higgs bootstrap is inherent


in the tt condensate approach of Nambu [4] and Bardeen et al [5].


In the condensate model the Higgs boson is generated through a four-fermi


interaction at a high scale by summing the tt bubble diagrams as in Fig. 1.


This figure then represents the lowest order diagram for the Higgs-pole in the


s-channel.


Consider now the t-channel Higgs exchange amplitude as indicated in


fig.2. It is a t-channel sum of fermion bubbles in the same manner as the s-


channel sum of fig.1. In terms of , £ , the top-Yukawa coupling and the
t



Higgs mass, m , it can be expressed as follows
H





2


£ 2 u uvv
t (1)
t m2
2 ¤ H





where u and v are t and t spinors respectively. If we now try to solve the


bound state problem in the ladder approximation by iterating this amplitude


then an interesting thing happens. In fig.3 each term in the ladder sum (the


left column) is itself, according to fig.2, expressed as a sum of fermion


bubbles (the right hand side). We notice that the first term in each sum on the


right hand (i.e. the first column on the right after the equal-sign) when added


up will give the Higgs amplitude in the s-channel as in fig.1, the subsequent


terms on the right being unitarity corrections. That is, a sum of t-channel


Higgs-exchanges produces an s-channel Higgs amplitude (see fig.4).




This implies that the Higgs exchange potential will produce Higgs


boson as a bound state in the s-channel provided the coupling is strong


enough. Therefore a Higgs bootstrap is inherent in the four fermi condensate


model, at least in the ladder approximation. Of course, since color flows





3


either in the s-channel direction or the t-channel but not both simultaneously


in these diagrams, a strict bootstrap occurs only when N ¡ 1.
c



We note, however, that in the condensate model once the gap equation


is imposed, the expression for the mass of the Higgs boson itself in terms of


top-mass i.e.


m 2m (2)
H ¥



is independent of N . The coupling, of course, depends on N [5].
c c



How strong the top-Yukawa coupling should be to create bound states


and therefore to accomplish the bootstrap will be considered below within the


framework of the ladder approximation.


Instead of carrying out a general bootstrap program by varying m and
H



£ , we will consider only the question whether the Higgs boson mass (2)
t



reproduces itself.




II. The Bound State Problem


The bound state problem in the ladder approximation has been studied


in certain field theories [6], in non-relativistic potential theories with Yukawa


potentials [7] and in S-matrix theories [8], [9]. The solution is obtained


through dispersion relations by imposing the known analytic and unitarity




4


properties of partial wave scattering amplitudes expressed in a formalism of


the ratio N/D. The zeroes of D, then determine the bound states.




Ghergetta [10] has shown that the dispersion relations methods of the


type indicated above are better suited than the traditional methods in Nambu


Jona-Lasinio type models [11], specifically in the top quark condensation


models of Nambu [4] and Bardeen et al [5].




For our bound state calculation we use the Jacob and Wick [12]

left hand cut along ( , 1) with m 2m, as can be confirmed from (7).

The discontinuity of D across the right-hand cut is easily seen from (8)


and (9) to be N . The left hand discontinuity of N is D ImT , where "Im"

N is usually taken simply as the partial wave projection of the t-channel


one particle exchange amplitude (in our case, the partial wave projection of


the amplitude (1) given by (7)) without going through the dispersion integrals


in (11). This is what we will also assume for the Higgs exchange [9].


Therefore, we will take


N x T H
( ) ( x).
0



We note from (7) that N ( x) has the proper analytic structure. We need now


to obtain D(x). Before we insert N ( x) given above in the dispersion integral


(10) we note that £ , which was assumed constant, actually evolves according
t



to the renormalization group equations as




£

where the top-Yukawa coupling £ is evaluated at mass . Since £ is no
t t



longer restricted to its standard model value ( 1) at the top mass but can be






much larger, according to the top-color models [1],[2],[3], the above equation


implies a rapid increase in £ for larger values of 2 [13].
t





In (4) and (12) we note that since £ £ 2 2
¡ ( ), where ¡ t , the t-

t t





dependence of £ in the Higgs-exchange amplitude given by (4) must be taken
t



into account in the partial wave projection (5), and, therefore, in (7). The


integration in (5) of
cos from ­1 to +1 converts to

This implies that it is the region 2 2
0 which is relevent for £ ( ). From the

t



renormalization group equations (12) we note that £ ( 2 ) does not depend on

t



the sign of 2 and its explicit 2 dependence can be determined from the






appropriate boundary conditions.




Clearly then, depending on the functional form of £ ( 2 ), the above

t



integration and the subsequent dispersion relations integral (10) for p2 from 0


to ( i.e. x from 0 to ) from can be very complicated. A reasonable
W W





10


approximation would be to replace £ 2 by some sort of average , £ 2 , over 2 .
t t





Thus we change £ £
2 § 2 .
t t





It is also important to note that in addition to the possibility that £ can
t



be large at the top mass m [1], [2], [3], its evolution given by (12), can






make £ even larger as 2 increases. Bardeen et al [5] have emphasized that
t





if the tt system forms a bound state, then £ will blow up as § where
t





is the appropriate composite scale. Therefore,




£ 2 ¡ very large.
t




We will return later to the question of determining £ 2 .
t




From (7) we note that

The integral in (10) for D, therefore, will not converge making it necessary to


introduce a subtraction to represent the unknown high scale dynamics with D


normalized so that D=1 at the subtraction point. Since we are looking for


possible bound states i.e. zeroes in D in the region
1 x 0 it is essential that
¤





11


the subtraction point not include this region. We will take, in the following,


the subtraction point at x
¡ , such that x 1, and discuss the bound state
¤ x1 1



energies as well as any sensitivities of the results to the subtraction point.


Taking account of the above comments we express D given by (10),


using (7) as

We write the above relation as,




£ 2
t
D( x) ¡ ¨

¤ (x x ) I (x, x )
32r 2 1 1





where I (x, x ) is the integral on the right hand side of expression (13). To
1



accomplish a bootstrap vis-à-vis the condensate model with m 2m (i.e.
H



x 0) we must have






D( )

Therefore the Yukawa coupling must satisfy

A plot of the right side of equation (15) is given in fig. 5 for x 1. We
1



find that it is insensitive to the precise choice of x for x 2 , being roughly a
1 1



constant over a large range of x , decreasing slowly, logarithmically. For a

typical x associated with an s-channel scale of 1 Tev ( x e f ), for

which x g 8, we obtain

Thus a Higgs bootstrap is possible as long as the averaged coupling


constant is consistent with (16). Next we consider whether this value is


reasonable based on the renormalization group equations.




III. Estimating £ 2t


To estimate £ 2 we note that the solution for (12) with the
t




compositeness boundary condition £ § as § is given by [5]

then we find that substituting (17) in (18) will make the integral infinite


because of the singularity at

A more convergent way to estimate £ 2 may be by extrapolating £ 2 at
t t

Eliminating the logarithm from (20), using (21) (with N 1) we obtain, using

the standard model value for b, the following estimate for the top-Yukawa


coupling at the top mass,

This is a rather large value but consistent with the top-color model estimates


[1], [2], [3].


We, therefore, conclude that the Higgs bootstrap which is inherent in


the ladder diagram approach of the condensate models is actually feasible for


sensible values of £ .
