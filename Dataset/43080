Abstract--High orders of perturbation theory can be calculated by the Lipatov method, whereby they are
determined by saddle-point configurations, or instantons, of the corresponding functional integrals. For most
field theories, the Lipatov asymptotic form has the functional form caN(N + b) (N is the order of perturbation
theory) and the relative corrections to it are series in powers of 1/N. It is shown that this series diverges facto-
rially and its high-order coefficients can be calculated using a procedure similar to the Lipatov one: the Kth
expansion coefficient has the form const[ln(S ­K
1/S0)] (K + (r1 ­ r0)/2), where S0 and S1 are the values of the
action for the first and second instantons of this particular field theory, and r0 and r1 are the corresponding num-
ber of zeroth-order modes; the instantons satisfy the same equation as in the Lipatov method and are assumed
to be renumbered in order of their increasing action. This result is universal and is valid in any field theory for
which the Lipatov asymptotic form is as specified above. © 2000 MAIK "Nauka/Interperiodica".
