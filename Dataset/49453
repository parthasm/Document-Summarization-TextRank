Abstract

The Chou-Yang model based on multiple diffraction theory has already been used
by us to predict the characteristics of antiproton-proton elastic scattering at very
high energies. But the recent precise data on proton electric form factor obtained at
JLab essentially deviates from the dipole approximation. We have parametrized
the data for the form factor. The computations have been made by using the new
expression for the form factor. The implications of the new form factor on the
characteristics of antiproton-proton elastic scattering at very high energy have
been studied.



The measurements of various characteristics of proton-proton and proton-antiproton elastic
scatterings [1-23] have played an important role in the development of high energy physics. The
various models have been proposed at various stages [24-39] and modified or demolished by the new
experimental results. One of models that has persisted with time is based on the diffraction theory
and is called the generalized Chou-Yang model. We would give a physical picture of proton-
antiproton elastic scattering in this model. The colliding particles are clusters of objects called
partons that collide with each other in pairs. At high energy, when the wavelengths are very small, it
is feasible to describe the interaction between these clusters of partons as involving successive
collisions between every parton of one cluster with individual partons making up the other cluster.
This interaction depends critically upon the relative positions of these partons, and, therefore, upon
the pair and possibly higher correlation functions. The multiple scattering effect is small compared
to single scattering at small momentum transfer as the peripheral partons dominating the process in
this region are not expected to suffer more than one collision before they leave the scattering region.
The differential cross section in this case is therefore a consequence of a single scattering. Since the
pristine Chou-Yang model tacitly assumes such a scattering, it becomes consistent with the
generalized Chou-Yang model and also with the experimental data in the diffraction peak region. At
high momentum transfer, that is, at large !t, where the form factor and, therefore, the single
scattering cross section is small, the correlation effect becomes observable. It is this effect that is
1


responsible for the difference between the experiment and the predictions of the pristine Chou-Yang
model in the large !t region. In fact, for large !t, central partons constituting a colliding particle
suffer successive collisions with two or more partons of other particles before leaving the scattering
region. This introduces an additional function in the integrand in the expression for the opacity. This
must be a slowly varying function of t so that for small angle scattering, that is, for the diffraction
peak region, it reduces to . 1, yielding the pristine Chou-Yang model. For large angle scattering, i.e.,
beyond the diffraction peak region, this function makes significant contribution; this is why in this
region only the multiple diffraction theory that takes into account the role of this function, is
successful.
The model depends upon two parameters, K and , to be determined by experimental data.
Recently, Saleem et al. [40] have proposed a formula that at any given high energy yields the values
of these parameters. By using the anisotropy function, (1 + At)/(1 !At) n , A = 1/3 GeV-2, n = 1/3,
the values of differential and total cross sections and other characteristics of antiproton-proton elastic
scattering were obtained and found to be consistent with experiment. However, recently precise
measurements of proton form factor have shown [41] that for Q2 = !3.5 GeV2, the shape is
significantly different from the dipole approximation or other forms based on earlier measurements
in the region where precise measurements have been made. We have found that in view of the recent
precise measurements, the expression for the proton electric form factor has to be changed from

GP = 0.6405 exp (4t) + 0.33 exp (0.85t) + 0.028 exp (0.22t) + 0.0015 exp (0.05t)
to
GP = 0.6405 exp (4t) + 0.33 exp (0.75t) + 0.023 exp (0.20t) + 0.0012 exp (0.04t).

The programme was run after substituting the new expression for the form factor. It was found that
for large values of !t, the values of differential cross section decreased significantly. This clearly
indicated that the anisotropy function had to be changed. For that purpose, we chose A = 0.25 GeV-2
and n = 0.25 in the expression for the anisotropy function. The results obtained with this choice may
be considered consistent with experiment. The results obtained for differential cross sections at s =
546, 630, 900, 1020, 1080 GeV and 10 TeV, along with the experimental data wherever available,
are shown in Figs. 1 to 4.

We conclude that the new precise measurements of the proton electric form factor reflect the
fact that the anisotropy function for antiproton-proton elastic scattering has to be changed. We may
point out that the anisotropy function has been taken as energy independent; once it is determined,
the same expression is to be used at all energies.
The total cross section values are 59.5, 64.4, 65.7 and 71.7 mb at the centre of mass energies
546 GeV, 900 GeV, 1.02 TeV and 1.8 TeV, respectively. These are consistent with the experimental
values of 61.9 ± 1.5, 65.3 ± 0.7 ± 1.5, 61.1 ± 5.7 and 72.8 ± 3.1 mb. .
