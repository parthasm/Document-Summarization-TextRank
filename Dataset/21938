We have studied numerically the evolution and decay of axion strings. These global defects decay
mainly by axion emission and thus contribute to the cosmological axion energy density. The relative
importance of this source relative to misalignment production of axions depends on the spectrum.
Radiation spectra for various string loop configurations are presented. They support the contention
that the string decay contribution is of the same order of magnitude as the contribution from
misalignment.

Lastly, we studied rotating, parallel string-
antistring pairs, which can be thought of as
cross-sections of loops with large eccentricity.
