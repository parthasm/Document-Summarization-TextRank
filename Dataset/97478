For any near-threshold asymptotic regime and for any Feynman diagram (involving loop and/or
phase space integrals), a systematic prescription for explicitly constructing all-logs, all-powers
(all-twists) expansions in perfectly factorized form with explicit integrals for coefficients, is pre-
sented. The distribution-theoretic nature of the method of asymptotic operation employed allows
treatment of totally exclusive phase space in the same manner as loop integrals.
