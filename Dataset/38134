1 - Introduction

The development of the quantum cosmology has been an important motivation in the

sense that the initial conditions for the emergence of the Universe as a classical result have

been explained. In principle the form of the wave function satisfying the Wheeler-DeWitt

equation must be obtained [1]. This equation describes the annihilation of the wave function

by the Hamiltonian operator and admits an infinite number of solutions. The boundary

conditions must be taken in order to specify the wave function uniquely and are viewed as an

additional physical law [2]. On the other hand, in string theory there were many attempts to

develop a consistent theory of string cosmology where inflation plays an important role [3].

The solutions of the non-linear sigma model equations in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker

background for the graviton, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor have been found [4, 3].

Furthermore, for isotropic Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmologies, which are restricted to

flat space, the dilaton-graviton sector of the string effective action is invariant under an

inversion of the scale factor and a shift in the dilaton field [5]. A supersymmetric extension of

the quantum cosmology is obtained from the scale factor duality, which is a subgroup of T-

duality [6, 7]. Moreover, N = 2 supersymmetric approach to quantum cosmology, with

spatially flat and homogeneous Bianchi type I Universe admitting d-compact abelian

isometries, is developed by employing the non-compact global symmetries of the string

effective action [8].

The purpose of the present paper is to develop an N = 4 supersymmetric approach to

quantum cosmology whose bosonic sector is invariant under global O(d,d) transformations.

The outline of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we recall the N = 2 supersymmetric

approach to quantum cosmology given by J. E. Lidsey and J. Maharana [8] which leads to the

O(d,d) invariant Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In section 3, we present the extension of this

model to the N = 4 supersymmetric case where the bosonic sector is invariant under the global

O(d,d) transformations. The corresponding super-constraints on the wave function are then

obtained. Thereafter, we derive the classical Hamiltonian by using the classical momenta

conjugate to the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the N = 4

supersymmetric quantum constraints are solved for the zero fermion and one-fermion states

leading to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Finally, in section 4, we make concluding remarks

and discuss our results.

In this section we recall the N = 2 supersymmetric approach to quantum cosmology given

by J. E. Lidsey and J. Maharana in ref. [8] where the non-compact global symmetries of the

string effective action are used. However, the tree-level string effective action is given by [9].

and the potential W(D) is an arbitrary function of D. The expansion of the potential W(D)

around and the use of the expressions (2.14) and (2.15) in (2.17) and (2.18) leads

respectively to

Therefore, there exists an N = 2 supersymmetric in quantum cosmology [13,7] which can be

considered as a direct extension of the O(d,d) T-duality of the toroidally compactified string

effective action (2.1). In the next section, we show that there exists even N = 4

supersymmetry in the quantum cosmology.

3 - N = 4 Supersymmetric String Quantum Cosmology

It is known that a hidden symmetry exists in all Bianchi class A models [14] where the

classical superspace Hamiltonian may be viewed as the bosonic part of a supersymmetric

Hamiltonian [7]. This implies that a supersymmetry can be introduced at the quantum level.

These supersymmetric extensions of the quantum theory have significant consequences for

quantum cosmology and may provide valuable insight into some of the questions relevant to a

complete theory of quantum gravity [15]. However, in order to obtain an N = 4

supersymmetric lagrangian whose bosonic sector is invariant under the global O(d,d)

transformations we consider the generators for the N = 4 supersymmetry which are defined by

isotropic cosmologies derived from the Brans-Dicke gravity action exhibit a scale factor

duality invariance [18,6]. This classical duality, associated with the hidden N = 2

supersymmetry at the quantum level [18,6], can also be studied for the N = 4 supersymmetric

case. Finally, the dualities of the Bianchi models related to N = 4 supersymmetry would be of

interest to be investigated.

4 - Conclusion

In this paper, we have derived an N = 4 supersymmetric quantum cosmology from the

N= 4 supersymmetric effective action. The N = 4 supersymmetric Hamiltonian operator is

obtained by using the momenta conjugate to the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. In

the classical limit this operator reduces to the O(d,d) invariant Hamiltonian. The constraints

on the wave function of the Universe are imposed by supersymmetry and imply that it should

be annihilated by supercharges. On the other hand, the solutions of the N = 4 supersymmetric

constraints are found for the zero and one-fermion states. We have seen that when the

- -
fermionic states 0 and C 0 are not identical the potential V ( ) has to be cancelled.

Moreover, for the case where these two states are equivalent the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is

obtained and differs from the N = 2 supersymmetric case just by the second derivative of the

potential W which has been taken into account.
