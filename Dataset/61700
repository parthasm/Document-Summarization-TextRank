physics beyond the standard model, which include the excess of jets at large transverse
energies at the pp collider [2] and of the events with large squared four momentum

transfer at the e+ p collider [3]. It is understood that any physics beyond the standard

model must explain the origin of the scale of order of G -1/2 governing weak
F

interactions since G -1/2 is not provided by the standard model. There are two main
F

streams to generate G -1/2 : One is to introduce supersymmetry (SUSY) [4-6] that
F

provides beautiful theoretical framework to manipulate radiative corrections, which in
turn ascribe G -1/2 to the scale of SUSY breaking and the other is to assume possible
F

sizes of the order of G1/2 for some of fundamental particles [7-9]. Lots of attempts
F

have been made to explain new events by assuming SUSY or compositeness [10, 11].

Since SUSY models essentially rely upon the Higgs phases of assumed nonabelian

gauge theories, their dynamical structure is well understood except for the SUSY

breaking dynamics. On the other hand, dynamics of generating composite quarks and

leptons has not yet clearly been understood. Recent theoretical understanding of N=1

SUSY confining gauge theories [12] greatly helps us toward constructing realistic

composite models of quarks and leptons [13, 14]. The key features are duality and

holomorphy, where the duality has originated from the study of ordinary gauge theories

[15] without SUSY.

In the present article, we utilize the duality in confining gauge theories to describe

compositeness of quarks and leptons and compare their interactions with those

generated by another dynamical model based on nonlinear interactions of the four Fermi

type to create composite quarks and leptons as well as Higgs scalar [8]. Our gauge
68
model is based on SU oc
(2) ื U oc
( )
1 ื 68(2) oc [16, 17], where (2) oc operates
L
Y
L
L






on left-handed states and gets confined to create composite quarks and leptons. The

physics for composite quarks and leptons in the confining phase turns out to be the same
68
as the one in the Higgs phase at "low" energies below the scale of (2) oc . In the
L






Higgs phase, the usual SU oc
(2) ื U oc
( )
1 ื 68(2) oc gauge model shows up and
L
Y
L






gauge bosons are mixed with W and Z by mass terms, while in the confining phase, all
68
particles including quarks and leptons are (2) oc -singlets and composite vector
L






bosons are mixed with W and Z by kinetic terms. We then demonstrate that the

physics in the confining phase can be reproduced by nonlinear interactions of the four
Fermi type among subconstituents, where the SU oc

respected. Explicit evaluations on effective interactions for composites lead to

precisely the same "low" energy interactions as those obtained in the confining phase,

thereby, in the Higgs phase.

the Higgs scalar, H, and the additional scalar, . To supply compositeness, the
68
relevant fields must carry the (2) oc -color and do not carry the usual SU oc

which are all (2) oc -singlets. In the preonic version, the corresponding

as scalars carrying three colors and lepton number [7]:

whose quantum numbers are listed in Table 2. Since the healthy gauge theory must not

contain anomalies, the electric charges of w is fixed to be (1/2, -1/2) for (w , w ).

Compositeness due to nonlinear interactions of the four Fermi type

To realize the compositeness in the preonic version, we adopt nonlinear interactions

of the four Fermi-type. Composite quarks, leptons and the Higgs scalar are assumed to

be generated by the following lagrangian, / [16]:

Now, we are ready to discuss the connection between the derived effective

lagrangians for composites: one is based on the confining phase of (2) oc , (12), and

the other on the nonlinear interactions, (26). By replacing fields and couplings

one finds that all couplings for quarks, leptons and vector bosons precisely coincide

with each other. Therefore, only one "low"-energy physics appears to govern these

composite particles.

Epilogue

We have shown two types of dynamical composite models of quarks, leptons and

Higgs scalar, which involve extra weak bosons, W and Z . The low-energy physics

described by both models turn out to be the same as far as scalar excitations are frozen.

The physical equivalence between massive gauge bosons and composite vector bosons

has been advocated in earlier references [19]. Of course, the differences arise if we go
68 68
to higher energies. In the model based on the confining (2) oc , the (2) oc -
L L

"gluons" emerge instead of W and Z while in the model based on preonic
configurations, W and Z are disolved into the subconstituents, w and w . This
68
situationn is shown in Figure 1. The duality in (2) oc ensures that effective
L 68
interactions for composites are identical to the spontaneously broken (2) oc , where
L

all particles are elementary objects. Thus, if W and Z are observed as

"elementary" particles, it does not directly suggest that they are massive gauge bosons
68
associated with the broken (2) oc . The present quantum number assignment of
L
68
(2) oc for quarks and leptons are motivated by implementing their compositeness
L 68
into the gauge model. Another interesting case is to require that (2) oc only
L

operates on quarks. Then, quarks become composites and interacts with extra
68
(2) oc bosons while leptons remain as "elementary" particles. This case
L

corresponds to "leptophobic" [20]. The preliminary analysis on the "leptophobic" case

has been performed in Ref.[21]. The other case, where all quarks and leptons are

"elementary", is called "fermiophobic" [22].

In the present context, there is no reason why most of observed quarks and leptons
are so light. One solution is to invoke the chiral SU ( )
4 version of the Pati-Salam

symmetry [7] for A,0
c with the appropriate anomaly-matching conditions satisfied [23].

To implement this symmetry calls for fermionic A,0
c instead of the scalar A,0
c . Then,

quarks and leptons become of the whc -type [8]. Another solution may utilize SUSY

with Nambu-Goldstone supermultiplets on the coset space such as

4 SU ( )
4 SU ( )
2 , whose fermionic components are of

the cw -type [13]. With this possibility of the SUSY extension in mind, the analyses

on the SUSY version of SU oc
(2) ื U oc
( )
1 ื 68(2) oc , which will corresponds to the

preonic SUSY configuration of SU oc

The predicted properties of the Z boson by the standard model are consistent with

those observed by the precision measurements at the CERN Large Electron-Positron

Collider, our predictions on the Z properties must at least reproduce those observed

properties. The effects from W on the weak interaction phenomenology can be kept
mild since it couples to the left-handed currents as W does. In the present model of
weak bosons, the standard model prediction will be recovered in the limit of m m
W Z ,
yielding s
0 even if W and Z are kept light. The simple computation leads
,

to the following behavior of the coupling parameter, :
2 2
sin (
(m m - m m .
Z -
Z )2 )1(1 ( W Z)2) (44)

The masses of W and Z are shown to satisfy the modified mass relation:
m m = cos m
m ,
W W Z Z (45)

which can be experimentally checked. The extensive studies on extra weak bosons

have lately been made in Ref.[22] but our present case is not involved. To get definite

conclusions about constraints on couplings and masses, we have to perform absolute

evaluations including all the calculable radiative corrections [24], which will be

presented elsewhere.
